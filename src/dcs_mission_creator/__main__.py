# PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK
"""CLI entry-point: discover and run `MissionBuilder` subclasses by name.

Each module under `dcs_mission_creator.missions` that defines a concrete
subclass of `MissionBuilder` (with a `name` slug) is exposed as a subcommand
of the same name. The CLI instantiates the class with the requested player
count and calls `.generate(output_dir)`, which writes both the `.miz` and a
`README.md` describing the mission.

Usage:
    dcs-mission-creator list
    dcs-mission-creator generate coastal_cover [--output-dir DIR] [--players N]
    dcs-mission-creator generate                # every discovered mission
    dcs-mission-creator audit [<name>]          # build without saving, report
    dcs-mission-creator route <theater> --via LAT,LNG --via LAT,LNG [...]
    dcs-mission-creator map-overlay build <theater> [--layers L,L,...]
    dcs-mission-creator map-overlay inspect <theater> [--layers L] [--out FILE]
    dcs-mission-creator map-overlay query <theater> --point X,Z --layer L

Shell completion (argcomplete):
    # one-shot, current shell
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete dcs-mission-creator)"
    # or enable global completion once:
    activate-global-python-argcomplete --user

    much margin against what the system really reaches, what the same margin
