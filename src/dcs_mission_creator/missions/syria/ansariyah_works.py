"""Syria 'Ansariyah Works' — F-16C deep strike on a rocket-motor plant, on the deck.

The player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of **Akrotiri** as `Colt`. The target is a
Syrian solid-rocket-motor plant in a basin on the seaward side of the Jebel
al-Ansariyah, above the village of Al-Ghansala: a casting hall, a motor store
and an oxidiser plant, 279 km east of the field with the whole eastern
Mediterranean in between.

**The ingress is low because the arithmetic says so, not because it reads well.**
A Russian-supplied S-200 sits on the coastal plain behind Jableh, and the 5V28's
own numbers — `H_min = 300 m`, `D_min = 17 km`, `D_max = 240 km`, straight out of
`<DCS>/CoreMods/tech/TechWeaponPack/Database/Weapons/misc_sams.lua` — decide the
whole sortie. It reaches most of the way to Cyprus, so there is no altitude to
cross the sea at; and it cannot bring a missile below three hundred metres, so
there is a floor under it that nothing on this coast can take away. The mission
is the 250 km of water between those two facts, flown at fifty metres.

Note what that premise deliberately is **not**. DCS models no earth curvature, so
"under the horizon" is not a thing a mission may promise over open water: a
coastal radar sees a wave-top jet as far as its detection range reaches, and the
Syrians here *will* see `Colt` cross the beach. What the briefing claims is only
what the game will honour — that they cannot shoot him — and the detection is
load-bearing rather than a leak: it is what rolls the load-out out of the plant
and scrambles the alert pair, so the mission's whole second half is caused by the
player being seen.

Three things layer on top of that, and they are the sortie rather than a target
list:

1. **Two bombs, three aimpoints.** The casting hall is the campaign objective and
   is not negotiable. The second bomb is a choice the briefing lays out and does
   not make: the **motor store**, which is this month's production and only worth
   a bomb while it is still in the building, or the **oxidiser plant**, which is
   next year's and cannot be replaced inside a year. A pair still chooses —
   only one of its two jets carries bombs, the other is the flight's air cover
   — and a four-ship does not have to, which is the one place `--players`
   changes the shape of the mission rather than its size.
2. **The load-out is a clock.** The transporters roll for a tunnel portal 13 km
   up the ridge the moment the coastal radar calls `Colt` feet dry, and past the
   portal they are out of reach. That is what makes the store worth less the
   longer the run takes — and it is what `Chevy`, an F/A-18C pair holding on the
   deck 130 km west of the beach, is for.
3. **Getting out is a third problem.** Hitting the plant is what puts the Hama
   alert pair overhead and releases `Chevy` across a coast that is now awake.
   `Colt` carries four air-to-air missiles and `Eagle` cannot follow him past the
   Gammon's ring, so nothing airborne is a required kill — the frag is the plant.

Two things are deliberately absent from the F10 map, the cartridge and every
friendly flight plan, and both are named as gaps in the briefing rather than
sprung (the rules are in the `dcs-mission` skill):

- **an SA-11 in the Ghab**, 26 km east of the plant. Measured against the
  elevation raster it has no line of sight to any briefed point of the corridor
  or to the target below 2,000 m, and it has line of sight to the target at
  3,000 m — so it is aimed at the climb and at anyone who follows the column
  east, and it cannot touch the plan the player was handed.
- **the guns in the seam.** The gap between the Latakia and Tartus batteries is a
  missile gap, not a defence gap, and the briefing says so without saying where.

Composition (difficulty: veteran):
  - S-200 'Gammon' site behind Jableh — Tin Shield SR + Square Pair TR + 4
    launchers, Skill High, radiating throughout. Briefed at 160 km. Not a target.
  - 2x S-125 coastal batteries, Latakia and Tartus, 71 km apart, Skill Average.
    The 25 km of coast between their briefed rings is the crossing.
  - 1x 55G6 EWR on the coastal ridge above Baniyas, Skill High — the trip wire.
  - 1x SA-8 Osa and 2x ZU-23 at the plant, Skill High / Average.
  - 1x SA-11 Buk in the Ghab, Skill High. On no map and in no cartridge.
  - Syrian load-out: 3x Ural-375 transporters, 2x BTR-80, 1x Strela-10M3,
    late-activated on the coast crossing, road-marching to a tunnel portal.
  - 2-6x MiG-29A alert at Hama, Skill High, scrambled on the coast crossing,
    scaled off the player's own magazine.
  - An S-125 battery with gun sections over Hama, so a MiG that turns for home
    stops being a target.
  - USAF support: E-3A `Magic`, KC-135 `Texaco` (TACAN 10X), F-15C `Eagle`
    TARCAP, F/A-18C `Chevy` on the load-out, and a Patriot battery (`BULWARK`)
    over Akrotiri whose envelope is the sixteen kilometres of sky the tanker
    track lives in — inside our missiles and outside theirs.
  - Weather: spring sunrise, broken layer at 1,500 m, haze, light NW wind.

====================================================
SITUATION
  A Syrian solid-rocket-motor plant is running in a
  basin on the seaward side of the Jebel al-Ansariyah,
  above Al-Ghansala. Three buildings matter: a casting
  hall, a motor store and an oxidiser plant. Command
  wants the hall down this morning.

  The plant is 279 km east of Akrotiri and every metre
  of that is water. A Russian-supplied S-200 battery on
  the plain behind Jableh has been radiating for weeks
  and reaches most of the way back to Cyprus. There is
  no altitude to cross in.

  What that battery cannot do is bring a missile below
  300 m. That is the whole plan: you go the width of the
  eastern Mediterranean at 60 m over the water and you
  do not climb. They will see you — assume they do — but
  seeing you and reaching you are different problems.

MISSION (Colt — F-16C-50, Akrotiri, hot ramp)
  - Climb east and take your gas from Texaco.
  - Start down at LETDOWN and be level at DECK. Those
    four minutes are the exposed part of the outbound:
    you are inside the Gammon's envelope and above its
    floor the whole way down, and there is no profile
    that avoids it. Do not stretch it.
  - Cross the coast north of Baniyas, between the
    Latakia and Tartus batteries. That gap is missiles
    only; there are guns under it. Do not linger on it.
  - Work inland behind the coastal hills to the IP, then
    north into the basin.
  - TWO BOMBS, THREE AIMPOINTS. The casting hall is the
    mission and is not a choice. The second is:
      MOTOR STORE   — this month's motors, and only
                      while they are still in it.
      OXIDISER PLANT — next year's, and a year to
                      replace.
  - Egress WEST to the water, the short way, still on
    the deck. Climb only when you are outside the ring.
  - RTB Akrotiri. Divert: Paphos.

LOADOUT (one bomber, one escort)
{self.loadout_brief("Colt", _FITS)}
  Two bombs, three aimpoints. Slot 2 carries no bomb: it
  is the only cover you have east of the band.

                 line between our Patriot and their
                 Gammon. Plan on him twice.
  Eagle        : F-15C pair, TARCAP on the same band.
                 He cannot follow you past the ring.
  Chevy        : F/A-18C pair holding on the deck 130 km
                 west of the beach, fragged against the
                 plant's load-out. He goes when you have
                 put the hall down.

INTELLIGENCE
  No overhead of the basin — the pass was cloud and the
  next one is tomorrow. What we have is three weeks of
  emitter work and partner-force reporting on the plant
  itself, so every ring on your map is drawn wide,
  dashed and marked approximate. The THREE AIMPOINTS
  are the exception and they are surveyed: HALL,
  STORE and OXIDISER are steerpoints on the buildings
  themselves. Reporting on the ground is what we do
  have, and a satellite-aided bomb has to have it.
  SAM : S-200 behind Jableh. Assess 160 km against a
        fighter. Floor 300 m — that is the number this
        sortie is built on. It is NOT your target.
  SAM : two S-125 batteries, Latakia and Tartus, about
        18 km each. Your crossing is the water between
        them.
  SAM : short-range cover on the plant itself, Osa
        class, and guns with it.
  EWR : search radar on the ridge above Baniyas. It
        will call you across the beach. Expect the
        alert pair to launch off that call and expect
        the load-out to start rolling on it too.
  GAP : a Gadfly-class emitter came up east of the
        range twice last week and we never fixed it.
        There is no ring on your map because we would
        be drawing a guess. It cannot see the corridor
        or the basin from where we think it is. It can
        see anything that climbs, and it can see the
        road east of the portal. Stay low, do not
        follow the column inland.
  Air : Hama holds the alert pair for this sector,
        MiG-29A, experienced. Hama is defended in its
        own right.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Weapons free on the plant, on its own air defence
    and on the load-out.
  - HARD DECK IS A HARD FLOOR: 60 m over water, 150 m
    over land, from the letdown to feet wet. Above 300 m
    inside the ring you are a target and there is no
    manoeuvre that fixes it.
  - The Gammon is not fragged. Two bombs do not open an
    S-200 and you do not have the fuel to argue with it.
  - Do not follow the column past the tunnel portal.
  - Not cleared to pursue over Hama.
  - Nothing airborne is a required kill. The plant is
    the frag.
  - Bingo fuel: 3000 lb at feet wet. Texaco is where you
    left him.

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY})
  Akrotiri sits under a {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery —
  {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, cyan ring on the map, guns in the
  overhead. Paphos is inside the same envelope. That
  ring and the Gammon's very nearly touch, and the sky
  between them is where Texaco and Eagle are holding:
  cross it westbound and the sortie is over.
  {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a hold abeam Akrotiri, on the map
  and in the DED.

NAV
  Bullseye (own side) : {bx:.0f}, {by:.0f} (DCS world m)
  TEXACO    : the AR track, and the same point on
              the way home.
  LETDOWN   : the briefed edge of the ring. Start down.
  DECK      : level at sixty metres. Stay there.
  FEET DRY  : the crossing, north of Baniyas.
  ALQIN     : first turn inland, behind the hills.
  TANITA    : south leg, masked from the EWR.
  IP        : south of the basin. Run in north.
  HALL      : the casting hall. THE FRAG.
  STORE     : the motor store, 400 m out.
  OXIDISER  : the oxidiser plant, 430 m out.
              All three surveyed. Two bombs.
  EGRESS    : straight out west.
  FEET WET  : water. Still on the deck.
  CLIMB     : the ring edge westbound. Climb FROM here,
              not before — the whole egress is on the
              deck until this point.
  DESCENT   : let-down for Akrotiri.

FREQUENCIES
  Magic AWACS    : 251.000 AM

NOTES
  Sunrise 06:33 and you start with it — the beach is
  crossed in early light with the sun already up behind
  the target. Broken layer at 1,500 m, haze under it. The
  layer costs you nothing: the bombs are satellite-aided
  and all three aimpoints are on the cartridge as
  steerpoints.
  Expect roughly 80 minutes. Take the gas.

        return f"""# Ansariyah Works

**Theater:** Syria
**Date / time:** 3 April 2026, 06:35 local (sunrise)
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Colt`), Akrotiri, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Colt")}
**Difficulty:** veteran
**Expected sortie length:** ~80 minutes

## Situation

A Syrian solid-rocket-motor plant is running in a basin on the seaward side of
the **Jebel al-Ansariyah**, above the village of Al-Ghansala. Three buildings
matter: the **casting hall**, the **motor store** and the **oxidiser plant**.
Command wants the hall down this morning.

The plant is **279 km east of Akrotiri** and every metre of that is water. A
Russian-supplied **S-200** battery on the coastal plain behind Jableh has been
radiating for weeks and reaches most of the way back to Cyprus, so there is no
altitude to cross the sea at.

What that battery cannot do is bring a missile below **300 m**. That is the
whole plan, and it is the reason this sortie looks the way it does: you fly the
width of the eastern Mediterranean at sixty metres, you cross the coast in the
one stretch the short-range batteries cannot reach, and you do not climb.

**They will see you.** Assume the coastal radar calls you across the beach —
that is what it is for, and the mission is built on the assumption that it
works. Seeing you and reaching you are different problems, and the second one is
the only one you can do anything about.

## Mission

Climb east out of Akrotiri and take gas from `Texaco` on the way out. Start
down at `LETDOWN`, on the briefed edge of the Gammon's ring, and be level at
sixty metres by `DECK`.

**Those four minutes are the exposed part of the outbound and no profile avoids
them.** The ring is 160 km wide and the tanker has to sit outside it, so there
is no altitude at which the descent can be flown clear — you come off `Texaco`,
cross the edge and go down through their envelope. Fly it at idle, do not
stretch it, and understand that this is the price of not swimming home. From
`DECK` to `FEET WET` you are under their floor and they have nothing that
reaches you.

Cross the coast north of Baniyas, work inland behind the coastal hills, and run
into the basin from the south.

**Two bombs, three aimpoints.** The **casting hall** is the campaign objective
and is not a choice — it is what makes motors, and until it is gone nothing else
here matters. The second bomb is yours:

| Aimpoint | What it costs them | When it is worth a bomb |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **Motor store** | This month's finished motors | Only while they are still inside. The transporters roll as soon as you are called across the beach. |
| **Oxidiser plant** | Next year's production — a year to replace | Always. It is the slower and larger loss, and it is the one that does not care how long your run took. |

A pair still has to choose: only slot 1 carries bombs, and slot 2 is the cover
that lets it get to the basin. Four slots put a second bomber up and the choice
goes away. Choose from what you can actually see through the pod on the way in.

Egress **west** to the water — the short way, still on the deck — and climb only
when you are outside the ring. RTB Akrotiri; divert Paphos.

## Package

| Callsign | Type     | Base     | Role                                        |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Colt     | F-16C-50 | Akrotiri | Player strike pair — one bomber, one escort  |
| Magic    | E-3A     | Akrotiri | AWACS + ESM watch, 251.000 AM                |
| Texaco   | KC-135   | Akrotiri | Tanker, 270.000 AM, TACAN 10X                |
| Eagle    | F-15C x2 | Akrotiri | TARCAP over the tanker and the recovery      |
| Chevy    | F/A-18C x2 | Akrotiri | Held on the deck west of the beach, fragged against the plant's load-out |

`Eagle` holds on the same band as the tanker and **cannot follow you in**. The
sky he is holding in is about sixteen kilometres wide: inside `BULWARK`'s
envelope and outside the Gammon's briefed ring. That is not a scripting
convenience, it is the geometry of this coast, and it is why the flight is on
its own from the letdown to feet wet.

### `Colt` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Colt", _FITS)}

**Two bombs against three aimpoints** is the sortie, and it stays the sortie:
the second jet is not a second bomber. It is the only friendly cover east of
that sixteen-kilometre band — the coastal radar is briefed to call your crossing
and the alert pair launches off that call, and `Eagle` cannot come. A four-slot
flight puts a second bomber up and can take all three aimpoints; a pair chooses.

No laser anywhere in the flight. There is no altitude over this basin from which
a jet could hold a spot and live, which is why the bombs are satellite-aided and
why the aimpoints have to be surveyed onto the cartridge before start — `HALL`,
`STORE` and `OXIDISER`, one steerpoint on each building. A weapon that flies to
a number has to be given the right number, and you have nothing aboard to
correct it with.

## Intelligence

No overhead of the basin — the pass was cloud and the next one is tomorrow. What
we have is three weeks of emitter work and partner-force reporting on the plant,
so **every ring on your map is drawn wide, dashed and marked approximate**, and
so is the pre-planned pair on your HSD.

**The three aimpoints are the exception, and they are surveyed.** `HALL`,
`STORE` and `OXIDISER` are steerpoints on the buildings themselves, not on the
compound they stand in. The two kinds of claim are different in kind rather than
in confidence: an assessment is what emitter work gives you about what a *system
reaches*, and a building reaches nothing — it was put up before the war, it is
what the partner-force reporting is *about*, and it will be at the same
coordinate tomorrow. It is also the only way this sortie works. A GBU-31 flies
to the coordinate it is handed and there is no laser in the flight to correct
it, so an approximate aimpoint is not a thinner picture, it is a miss.

- **S-200 'Gammon' (the premise):** on the plain behind Jableh. Assess 160 km
  against a fighter-sized target at altitude, and a **300 m floor** it cannot
  shoot below. That ring is on your map and it covers your entire route from
  about a hundred kilometres east of Akrotiri to the beach. It is **not** your
  target: two bombs do not open an S-200 and you do not have the fuel to argue
  with it.
- **S-125 x2:** Latakia and Tartus, about 18 km each. They are the reason the
  crossing is where it is — there are twenty-five kilometres of coast between
  their rings and you are briefed into the middle of it.
- **The seam is a missile gap, not a defence gap.** There are guns on that
  stretch. Nobody has fixed them and nobody is going to; cross it fast and once.
- **Plant defences:** an Osa-class system on the works and guns with it. Ringed
  on your map at the same confidence as everything else.
- **EWR:** search radar on the ridge above Baniyas. Expect it to call you across
  the beach, expect the alert pair to launch off that call, and expect the
  load-out to start rolling on it as well.
- **Gap — the Gadfly:** a Gadfly-class emitter came up east of the range twice
  last week and we never got a fix on it. There is **no ring on your map because
  we would be drawing a guess.** From where we think it is, it cannot see the
  corridor or the basin at the heights you are briefed to fly. It can see
  anything that climbs, and it can see the road east of the portal. Stay low and
  do not follow the column inland.
- **Air:** Hama holds the alert pair for this sector — MiG-29A, experienced
  crews. Hama is defended in its own right; a battery on the field and guns in
  the overhead.

## The load-out

The plant runs a load-out at first light: motor transporters with an escort and
their own short-range cover, taking finished motors to a hardened tunnel portal
about thirteen kilometres up the ridge. Past the portal they are out of reach and
we are not going to dig them out.

They roll on the same call that scrambles the MiGs. That is what puts a clock on
the **motor store** and it is what `Chevy` is for — an F/A-18C pair holding on
the deck a hundred and thirty kilometres west of the beach, who will run the
column on the road once you have put the hall down.

## ROE

- Weapons free on the plant, its own air defence, and the load-out.
- **The hard deck is a hard floor:** 60 m over water, 150 m over land, from
  `LETDOWN` to `FEET WET`. Above 300 m inside the ring you are a target, and
  there is no manoeuvre that fixes that.
- **The Gammon is not fragged.**
- **Do not follow the column past the tunnel portal.**
- **Not cleared to pursue over Hama.**
- **Nothing airborne is a required kill.** Four missiles and no wingman below
  three slots: the alert pair is a threat to survive, not a target list. The
  plant is the frag.
- Bingo fuel: 3000 lb at feet wet.

## Fall-back

Akrotiri is covered by a `{_SANCTUARY}` {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery reaching
{_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, drawn as the cyan ring on the F10 map, with gun sections in
the overhead. **Paphos is inside the same envelope.**

That ring and the Gammon's briefed ring very nearly touch, and the band between
them is where `Texaco` and `Eagle` are holding. Westbound, crossing it is the end
of the sortie: an S-200 cannot follow you into it and a MiG that does is inside a
Patriot. `{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a hold abeam Akrotiri, on the map and in the
DED, for a jet waiting on the pattern.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- `TEXACO` — the AR track, and where you take gas again on the way home
- `LETDOWN` — the briefed edge of the Gammon's ring. **Start down here**
- `DECK` — level at sixty metres, 80 km short of the beach
- `FEET DRY` — the crossing, north of Baniyas, between the two coastal batteries
- `ALQIN` — first turn inland, behind the coastal hills
- `TANITA` — the south leg; masked from the Baniyas radar from here
- `IP` — south of the basin. Run in to the north
- `HALL` — the casting hall. **The frag**
- `STORE` — the motor store, 400 m from the hall
- `OXIDISER` — the oxidiser plant, 430 m from the hall. All three are surveyed
  steerpoints on the buildings; two of them get bombs and which two is yours
- `EGRESS` — straight out west off the target
- `FEET WET` — water, still on the deck
- `CLIMB` — the ring edge westbound. Climb **from** here and not before: the
  whole egress from `FEET WET` is flown on the deck, and the card shows it
- `DESCENT` — let-down for Akrotiri

The heights in the briefing are above the *ground*. Your kneeboard prints
altitudes, which is a different and always larger number, and the profile on it
clears the terrain on every leg including the ones between waypoints. Fly the
card.

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: 251.000 AM
- Texaco tanker: 270.000 AM, TACAN 10X
- Akrotiri tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` details and the Paphos divert are on the kneeboard comms card.

## Weather

Spring sunrise. Broken layer base 1,500 m, 700 m thick, density 6.
Visibility 20 km in haze. 14 °C. Light NW wind — 5 m/s ground, 9 m/s at 2,000 m,
16 m/s at 8,000 m. Sunrise at Akrotiri is 06:33 and you start with it; the coast
is a quarter of an hour ahead of it, so the beach is crossed in early light with
the sun already up behind the target.

The layer costs you nothing. The bombs are satellite-aided and the aimpoints are
on the cartridge — which is *why* you are carrying JDAM on a target you could
otherwise have lased. There is no altitude here from which you could self-lase
and live.

## Difficulty composition

**Veteran.** S-200 denying every usable altitude over a 279 km over-water
ingress, two coastal S-125 batteries defining the only crossing, an Osa and guns
on the objective, an unlocated Gadfly aimed at the climb, MiG-29A alert scaled
off the player count, a hard fuel case that makes the tanker structural, escort
that cannot cross the ring, an eastbound run-in into a low sun and a broken
layer. Enemy *positions* are drawn as assessments, several kilometres off
truth; the three aimpoints are buildings and are drawn and flown exactly.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Success:** the casting hall is down. What else went with it — the month's
  motors, next year's oxidiser, the column on the road — is the difference
  between a good morning and a very good one.
- **Failure:** `Colt` goes down with the hall still standing.

        with the flight's own route first and then the plan's points **in draw
        order**, and this route is fourteen points long, so the ten marks below
        fit with one slot spare and would start dropping off the end if anything
        else were added. The sanctuary goes first for the reason it always does:
        the marshal hold is the one mark a pilot might need with a broken jet.

        Two things are deliberately not drawn. The **Gadfly** has no ring because
        nothing in the briefing claims a position for it. And the **guns in the
        seam** have none either — a towed 23 mm section has no envelope worth a
        steerpoint, and the briefing carries the warning in prose instead, which
        is the honest shape for "there is something on that beach and we do not
        know where".

        The Gammon's ring is the drawing that makes the whole plan legible: it
        covers the route from a hundred kilometres east of Akrotiri all the way
        to the beach, so the deck run stops looking like an eccentric choice and
        starts looking like the only line there is.

        **The three aimpoints are labelled where they stand, and not drawn as an
        objective ring.** `PlanOverlay.objective` loosens with difficulty like
        `.threat` does, which is right for a place somebody assessed and wrong
        for three buildings that partner forces have been reporting on from the
        ground for three weeks — and it would then contradict the steerpoints,
        which have to be exact or the JDAM has nothing to fly to. Naming each
        building separately is the other half: the frag is one of the three and
        the second bomb is a choice between the other two, and a single marker
        over the compound puts that decision in the pod at 60 m rather than on
        the map before start. The labels carry the steerpoint names, so the map,
        the card and the DED call the same roof the same thing. This costs the
        cartridge nothing — `core/dtc.py` drops a mark standing on a steerpoint

        The cueing half is what makes the low ingress mechanically real rather
        than decorative. Left alone every DCS battery radiates from mission
        start, so the player's RWR would be full of S-125s before he left
        Cyprus and the seam would be a line on a map with nothing behind it.
        Here only two things are on the air at the start: the Baniyas EWR,
        because searching is what an early-warning radar is for, and the Gammon,
        because the briefing says it has been radiating for weeks and the
        player's RWR on the runway should confirm that. Everything else is dark
        until the net hands it a track inside its own reach.

        `act_as_ew` on the S-200 rather than a `go_live_percent`, which is the
        honest model of a 240 km search radar: it does not wait to be cued by
        anything, it *is* the cue. It also means the invariant `arm_iads` warns
        about is satisfied twice over, which matters on a coast where the EWR is
        a single vehicle a player could reasonably kill.

        The reaction half is present and will mostly never fire, and that is
        fine rather than waste: nothing in this package carries an
        anti-radiation missile, so no site here is ever going to be shot off the
        air. What the dials still buy is the emission discipline that comes with
        them — the coastal conscripts sit on the air in long looks and the
        Russian-crewed batteries work in short ones, which is the difference the
        briefing describes and the difference the RWR shows.

        `Magic` is the only listener, so every emissions call is his ESM watch.
        Over open water he has line of sight to both coastal batteries and to
        the Gammon; he has none at all to anything behind the range, so the
        Gadfly in the Ghab can come up and nobody says a word about it. That is
        the honest chain and it is exactly what the Intelligence section admits
        to.
