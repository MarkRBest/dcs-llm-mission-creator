"""Syria 'Eastern Shield' — F-16C SEAD/escort with layered objectives.

Player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Incirlik (callsign `Springfield`, the
USAF SEAD callsign), suppresses a Russian SA-6 site defending a forward
depot at Kuweires, then escorts A-10C `Hawg` onto the depot, then handles
a 2-ship MiG-29S scramble out of Bassel Al-Assad and an armored reserve
push from the Aleppo road. KC-135 `Texaco` and E-3A `Magic` cover the
sortie end-to-end (F-16C internal fuel is ~35 min; 2h sortie mandates a
tanker).

Composition (difficulty: trained):
  - SA-6 site: 1x Kub 1S91 search radar + 3x Kub 2P25 TEL + 2x ZU-23
    AAA on a ridgeline north of Kuweires. Skill High.
  - Russian forward depot at Kuweires: 3x BTR-80, 3x T-72B, 2x GAZ-66
    trucks, 1x SA-13 SHORAD overwatch, 2x ZU-23 AAA. Skill Average.
  - 2x 55G6 EWR chain along the Syrian frontier feeding GCI.
  - 2x MiG-29S, Skill High, R-77/R-27 class, late-activated from Bassel
    Al-Assad after the depot is destroyed.
  - Russian armored reserve (2x T-72B + 4x BTR-80) on the Aleppo road,
    activates and pushes west once the depot dies.
  - USAF support: E-3A Magic AWACS over the Mediterranean, KC-135 Texaco
    tanker (TACAN 10X, 270.000 AM), F-15C Eagle 2-ship TARCAP,
    A-10C Hawg 2-ship strike package.
  - Weather: late-spring eastern Med haze, light NW wind, 22 C.

==================================================
SITUATION
  Two weeks of imagery show Russian expeditionary forces
  standing up a forward supply depot on the Kuweires
  apron — revetted stores, trucks turning nightly.
  A Rivet Joint track four days ago picked up a Gainful
  fire-control radar on the ridge to the north; the site
  is relocatable, so treat the fix as approximate. The
  same collection has early-warning radars handing a
  picture to MiG-29S at Bassel Al-Assad.
  USAF has been tasked to break the depot and degrade
  Russian air defence coverage of the Aleppo corridor.

MISSION (Springfield — F-16C-50, Incirlik)
  Phase 1: Suppress the SA-6 site north of Kuweires.
  Phase 2: Escort Hawg 1-2 onto the depot once you can
           call the target box SAM-safe.
  Phase 3: Intercept any Russian fighters that scramble
           out of Bassel Al-Assad in response.
  Phase 4: Disrupt the armored reserve if it comes west
           on the Aleppo road to retake the ground.

LOADOUT (the flight splits the frag)
{self.loadout_brief("Springfield", _FITS)}
  Slot 1 puts the ridge down and releases Hawg. Slot 2 is
  your own answer to the Fulcrums — Eagle is 21 minutes
  from its station and cannot be it.

PACKAGE
  Springfield: F-16C-50 pair, Incirlik, hot ramp. Loadout
        above.
  Hawg 1-2 : A-10C, Incirlik, strike on depot. Holds
        west of the AO until Springfield calls SAM safe.
  Eagle 1-2: F-15C TARCAP, Incirlik, race-track east
        of the AO covering the strike.
  Magic    : E-3A AWACS, 251.000 AM, Med track north.
  Texaco   : KC-135 tanker, 270.000 AM, TACAN 10X,
        track over the Med west of Latakia.

INTELLIGENCE
  Air : ELINT and the AWACS picture put a MiG-29S pair
        at readiness at Bassel Al-Assad, current
        missiles, experienced crews. They will launch
        when the depot is hit. Early-warning radars
        along the frontier will vector them.
  SAM : Rivet Joint fix, four days old — an SA-6 site on
        the ridge north of Kuweires, reach about 25 km.
        The search radar is what feeds its launchers.
        Depot imagery also shows a tracked IR launcher
        parked inside the wire.
  AAA : Light guns emplaced on the SA-6 ridge and around
        the depot.
  Land: Ground reporting says an armored reserve sits
        east of Kuweires on the Aleppo road, held back
        to retake the site if we hit it.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Cleared to engage the SA-6 site and depot ground units.
  - Cleared to engage Russian aircraft entering the AO.
  - Stay out of the SA-6 engagement zone until you have
    put its search radar down.
  - Tank from Texaco pre-push and post-AO if needed.
  - Bingo fuel: 3500 lb. RTB Incirlik (no divert).

NAV
  Bullseye (own side): {bx:.0f}, {by:.0f} (DCS world m)
  SA-6 ridge        : ~8 km north of Kuweires.

**Theater:** Syria
**Date / time:** 21 May 2026, 09:00 local
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Springfield`), Incirlik, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Springfield")}
**Difficulty:** trained — one radar SAM over the target with SHORAD and guns,
experienced MiG-29S pair with GCI, an armoured counter-push, full support
package (AWACS, tanker, TARCAP)
**Expected sortie length:** ~120 minutes (2 hours)

## Situation

Two weeks of imagery show Russian expeditionary forces standing up a forward
supply depot on the Kuweires apron in northern Syria — revetted stores, trucks
turning nightly. A Rivet Joint track four days ago picked up a Gainful
fire-control radar on the ridge to the north; the site is relocatable, so
treat that fix as approximate. The same collection has early-warning radars
handing a picture to MiG-29S at Bassel Al-Assad. USAF is tasked to break the
depot and degrade Russian air defence coverage of the Aleppo corridor before
the Russian reserve can close the road.

## Mission

`Springfield` flight runs a four-phase package out of Incirlik:

1. **Phase 1 — SEAD.** Suppress the SA-6 site north of Kuweires. Its search
   radar is the priority target — the launchers on that ridge are blind
   without it, and the rest of the package waits on your call.
2. **Phase 2 — Strike escort.** `Hawg 1-2` holds west of the AO until
   `Springfield` calls SAM safe, then runs in on the depot. Stay between
   `Hawg` and the threat axis.
3. **Phase 3 — DCA.** The Bassel Al-Assad pair will launch once the depot is
   hit. Sanitize the airspace before they get a shot on the strike package.
4. **Phase 4 — Convoy interdict.** The armored reserve is expected to come
   west on the Aleppo road to retake the site. `Hawg` re-tasks if it can;
   otherwise `Springfield` rolls in with AGM-65 or guns on the column.

## Package

| Callsign    | Type    | Base     | Role                              |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Springfield | F-16C-50| Incirlik | Player SEAD flight / escort / DCA |
| Hawg 1-2    | A-10C   | Incirlik | Strike on depot (holds for SEAD)  |
| Eagle 1-2   | F-15C   | Incirlik | TARCAP race-track east of the AO  |
| Magic       | E-3A    | Incirlik | AWACS, 251.000 AM, Med track north|
| Texaco      | KC-135  | Incirlik | Tanker, 270.000 AM, TACAN 10X     |

### `Springfield` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Springfield", _FITS)}

Three kills are tasked here — the SA-6's search radar, the depot and the
Fulcrum pair — and the depot belongs to `Hawg`. The other two are not the same
aeroplane: a Viper carrying HARMs has spent stations 3 and 7 and flies with
four air-to-air missiles, a Viper without them flies with six. So slot 1 puts
the ridge down and releases `Hawg`, and slot 2 is the flight's own answer to
the Fulcrums. `Eagle`'s TARCAP is twenty-one minutes from its station when you
are over the target at nine, so it is cover for the egress rather than for the
merge.

## Intelligence

The SAM fix is four days old and the site is relocatable, so the ring on your
map is an estimate — expect to find it with the HTS, not with the mark.

- **SAM (priority):** SA-6 'Gainful' on the ridge north of Kuweires, reach
  about 25 km, with light guns emplaced alongside. Its search radar feeds the
  launchers; put that down and the ridge stops shooting.
- **SHORAD:** depot imagery shows a tracked IR launcher parked inside the wire
  and guns around the perimeter.
- **Air:** a MiG-29S pair at readiness at Bassel Al-Assad — current missiles,
  experienced crews — expected to launch once the depot is hit, vectored by
  early-warning radar along the frontier.
- **Land reserve:** ground reporting places an armoured reserve east of
  Kuweires on the Aleppo road, held back to retake the site if we strike it.
- **Bassel Al-Assad field defence:** the same ELINT work that put the MiGs at
  readiness puts an S-125 battery on their airfield, with self-propelled guns in
  the overhead. It is 172 km from the depot and reaches 18 km, so it touches no
  part of the strike — it is the reason a MiG that turns for home stops being a
  target.

## ROE

- Cleared to engage the SA-6 site, depot ground units, and any Russian
  aircraft entering the AO.
- Stay out of the SA-6 engagement zone until its search radar is down.
- Tank from `Texaco` pre-push and post-AO; F-16C internal fuel does not
  cover a 2-hour sortie without at least one tanker pass.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Bassel Al-Assad.** A withdrawing MiG is not
  worth an S-125, and it is 172 km the wrong way.
- Bingo fuel: 3500 lb. RTB Incirlik, or Gaziantep if the jet will not make it —
  see below.

## Fall-back

This is the longest egress in the set: the depot is **213 km** from Incirlik,
which on a good engine is fifteen minutes and on a damaged one is not a number
worth relying on. So there are two covered fields rather than one.

- `{_SANCTUARY}` — a {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery at Incirlik reaching {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km,
  drawn as the larger cyan ring, with gun sections in the overhead. Normal recovery. `{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a hold abeam the field
  inside the envelope, on the map and in the DED.
- `{_FORWARD_SANCTUARY}` — a {_FORWARD_BATTERY.name} battery at Gaziantep, the smaller ring. Its
  {_FORWARD_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km is a bubble over the field and the pattern and nothing further: it is not cover for a fight, it is cover for an approach. What it
  buys is distance — Gaziantep is 85 km from the target against Incirlik's 213.
  There is no marshal point there because nobody diverts in order to hold; the
  field itself is a steerpoint in your cartridge and a label on the map.

If the jet is hurt, turn for the nearer ring and say so on the way.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- SA-6 ridge: ~8 km north of Kuweires.
- Depot: Kuweires airfield apron and truck park.
- PUSH waypoint: 30 km southeast of Incirlik.
- Your data cartridge carries the Gainful and IR-launcher estimates as
  pre-planned threats — select PRE on the HSD (and they show on the HAD) to
  see the rings. They are the same estimates as the map, and no more precise
  than the fix behind them.

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: 251.000 AM
- Texaco tanker: 270.000 AM, TACAN 10X
- Incirlik tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` and `{_FORWARD_SANCTUARY}` details are on the kneeboard comms card.

## Weather

Late-spring eastern Mediterranean haze, light NW wind, 22 °C. QNH 760 mmHg.
Visibility 40 km (haze layer). Scattered layer at 2800 m, 400 m thick.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Primary success:** the SA-6 site is off the air for good and the depot is
  burning.
- **Full success:** the above, plus the fighter scramble defeated and the
  armoured reserve stopped short of Kuweires.
- **Failure:** `Hawg` is lost with the depot still intact, or the reserve
  reaches Kuweires and digs in.

        This is the only mission in the project with a **forward** sanctuary, and

        egress here by 60 km. `REDOUBT` covers home, and `PICKET` at Gaziantep
        covers a runway 85 km from the target — a jet losing oil pressure over
        Kuweires can reach one of those and not the other.

        The two systems are different because the geometry is. Hawk at Incirlik
        reaches 45 km into empty Turkish airspace; the same battery at Gaziantep
        would reach 40 km toward the AO, across the ground the MiGs transit and
        the strike egresses through, which is exactly the quiet mission rewrite
        `keep_clear` exists to refuse. NASAMS' 15 km covers the field, the
        overhead and the pattern and nothing else, which is all a divert needs.

        Bassel Al-Assad gets the red battery because that is where the MiG-21s
        recover. Kuweires is the field a mission would reach for first and the one
        `build_sanctuary` refuses outright: the depot **is** the Kuweires apron,
        so no envelope emplaced there clears the objective. Bassel is 172 km from
        the target, which makes 18 km of S-125 irrelevant to the strike and
