"""Syria 'Idlib Gauntlet' — F-16C convoy interdiction through a layered IADS.

Player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Hatay (callsign `Uzi`) against a Syrian
resupply column running north-west from Abu al-Duhur toward Taftanaz. The
column carries its own short-range air defence, and the corridor it drives
through is covered by three overlapping Russian-supplied SAM belts. The
difficulty is not the convoy — it is working inside the missile engagement
zones long enough to kill it before it reaches Taftanaz.

The column is resupplying a *front line*, and that line is why the sortie has
a shape at all (see `core/frontline.py`). Ninety kilometres of dug-in Syrian
positions run across the ingress axis with an S-125 battery holding each
shoulder, so the flanks are a hundred-kilometre detour into a missile envelope
rather than a turn — and the one sector without a battery on it is the SA-6's.
The seam is the way in, which is what makes SEAD the first phase instead of an
option. Beyond the northern shoulder sits a Gadfly battery the intel never
fixed: it is on no map and no cartridge, it covers the wide northern arc, and
it exists to charge for the flank the briefing said not to fly.

Every radar-guided site is one net (see `core/iads.py`), and that decides both
halves of the SEAD problem. The batteries sit dark; the early-warning chain
holds the picture and hands each one its target as the package comes into that
battery's reach, so the RWR fills in belt by belt rather than all at once on the
runway, and a site nobody flew near never announces itself.

Then they react to HARM fire the way real crews do: the missile is passive and
warns nobody, so what the crew gets is the *shooter* — a launch the site could
not see, and that nobody on its net saw either, is a launch it never learns
about. Otherwise the call goes out, the crew spends most of a minute acting on
it, the fire-control radar drops emissions, the missile goes for the last known
point, and the site is released several minutes later — to cold, so it comes
back only if there is still something to shoot at. HARMs therefore *suppress*
more often than they *kill*, and the player chooses between a standoff shot for
the dark window, a close one for the radar, and a masked one the crew never
sees.

Composition (difficulty: trained):
  - Syrian convoy `Nasr` (11 vehicles): 3x T-72B, 2x BTR-80, 2x Ural-375,
    plus organic SHORAD — 2x SA-13 Strela-10M3, 1x SA-19 Tunguska,
    1x ZSU-23-4 Shilka. Armor Average, SHORAD High.
  - Front line, 90 km of frontage 26 km short of the AO: 4 dug-in Syrian
    strongpoints (T-72B, BMP-2, Shilka, ZU-23, Igla-S) plus an SA-3 site on
    each shoulder, Skill Average.
  - Rear areas, 60 km off the AO on each beam: an SA-3 site in the southern
    sector, Skill Average, and in the northern one an SA-11 Buk, Skill High.
    The ground behind the line is held ground, so declining the corridor
    trades one envelope for another rather than for an empty sky.
  - Off the map: that Buk. Briefed as an emitter nobody fixed, so it has no
    ring, no cartridge point and no place in the friendly flight plan.
  - SAM belt 1 (long): SA-2 site at Abu al-Duhur, Skill Average.
  - SAM belt 2 (medium): SA-6 site on high ground over the convoy route,
    Skill High — the priority SEAD target.
  - SAM belt 3 (short, mobile): SA-8 site covering the Taftanaz off-load,
    Skill High.
  - 2x 55G6 EWR feeding the network and the GCI picture.
  - 2x MiG-29S alert-5 at Bassel Al-Assad, scrambled cold off the ramp once
    the convoy starts taking losses.
  - USAF support: E-3A `Magic`, KC-135 `Texaco` (TACAN 10X), F-15C `Eagle`
    TARCAP, MQ-9 `Hammer` FAC(A) lasing the column, F/A-18C `Pontiac` strike
    pair released once the SA-6 is down or the clock runs out.
  - Weather: late-summer Levant haze, light west wind, 30 C.

#:
#: Slot 1 is the Weasel — four AMRAAM, because there is an alert pair at Bassel

=====================================================
SITUATION
  Overhead imagery before first light caught a Syrian
  resupply column forming at Abu al-Duhur; a Reaper has
  been following it since and it is running north-west
  toward the Taftanaz off-load. Partner-force reporting
  out of the pocket says it carries the ammunition for
  the next push. It travels with its own short-range
  air defence.
  The ammunition is for the line, and the line is your
  problem before the column is. Ninety kilometres of
  dug-in Syrian positions sit between the pocket and
  that road, an S-125 battery holding each shoulder.
  One sector has no battery on it — the middle, which
  the SA-6 covers instead. That sector is the way in.
  A Rivet Joint track overnight mapped the corridor it
  drives through: three overlapping Russian-supplied
  SAM belts. Those crews are drilled — they drop
  emissions when they see an anti-radiation shot, and
  they stay off the air a while before coming back up.
  Expect to suppress, not to sanitize.

MISSION (Uzi — F-16C-50, Hatay)
  Cross the line at the seam, high. Suppress whatever
  belt is holding you off the target. Break the column
  up before it reaches Taftanaz. Render it
  combat-ineffective and the ammunition never reaches
  the pocket; the whole column is better.

LOADOUT (Weasel and bomber)
{self.loadout_brief("Uzi", _FITS)}
  Slot 1 works the belts; slot 2 works the column. Nothing
  either of you carries rides a laser — Hammer's spot is
  for Pontiac.

PACKAGE
  Uzi        : F-16C-50 pair, Hatay, hot ramp. Loadout
        above.
  Pontiac 1-2: F/A-18C, 4x GBU-12 coded {_LASER_CODE} + ATFLIR,
        Hatay. Held in reserve, pushing onto the column
        once the SAM threat over the route is suppressed.
  Eagle 1-2  : F-15C barrier CAP down the corridor on
        our side of the line.
  Hammer     : MQ-9, {_FREQ_FAC}.000 AM, FAC(A) over the
        corridor, lasing the column, code {_LASER_CODE}.
  Magic      : E-3A AWACS, {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM.
  Texaco     : KC-135, {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN 10X.

INTELLIGENCE
  FRONT: Partner-force positions face the line all the
        way across, so we know where it runs; the map
        has the trace. Each shoulder is an S-125
        battery, roughly 25 km of reach and 60,000 ft
        of ceiling — going round a wing means flying
        through one. Between them the frontage is
        armour, 23 mm guns and Igla teams: nothing
        above 10,000 ft, everything below it. Cross at
        the seam and cross high.
  REAR: The far side of the line is held ground, not
        open sky. There is a third S-125 battery in the
        southern rear, level with the convoy road, and
        the belts below cover the road itself — getting
        past the line somewhere else buys you a
        different envelope, not a free run.
        One more thing off last night's cut: a Gadfly
        search radar was heard on the net in the
        northern rear and never fixed. We have no
        position for it, so there is no ring on your
        map and none in the cartridge. Read it as that
        flank being spoken for and stay in the seam.
  SAM : From the Rivet Joint cut — an SA-2 belt around
        Abu al-Duhur, reach out to about 40 km; an SA-6
        belt on the high ground over the convoy route,
        about 25 km, and it is the one that owns the
        road; a mobile SA-8 at the Taftanaz off-load,
        about 10 km. Early-warning radars behind them
        hold the picture and hand the batteries their
        targets — the batteries themselves stay off the
        air until you are worth shooting at, so a quiet
        RWR out of PUSH is the net working, not the net
        being absent. Killing the search radars does not
        turn the belts off: cut off from the net they
        search on their own and radiate continuously
        from then on. That buys you emitters you can
        find, not silence. The SA-6 crew is the sharpest
        of the three; the SA-2 site is conscripts.
        Magic holds an ESM watch on the belts and calls
        a site off or back on the air when he hears it.
        That is his receiver, not a guarantee: high
        ground between him and a battery, or Magic off
        station, and nobody calls it for you.
  SHORAD: Reaper imagery shows tracked IR launchers, a
        gun-missile vehicle and a Shilka riding with the
        column. None of that shuts down for a HARM —
        kill it or stay outside 8 km.
  Air : ELINT has the alert pair at Bassel Al-Assad on
        cockpit alert. MiG-29S, experienced crews. That
        is minutes from the corridor — plan on them
        being airborne at some point in the sortie.
  Base: Bassel is defended in its own right — an S-125
        battery on the field, guns in the overhead, and
        it is in the same net as the belts. It is 102 km
        from the convoy road and reaches nothing you
        need. Do not follow the MiGs home.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Cleared to engage the convoy and any air defence
    covering it.
  - Cleared to engage Syrian and Russian aircraft in
    the corridor.
  - The line itself is not your target. Two HARMs will
    not open a shoulder and the strongpoints are the
    partner force's problem — cross the seam and leave
    them alone.

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY} / {_REAR_SANCTUARY})
  Hatay is a forward strip and the Syrian forward line
  stands 52 km off its threshold, closer to your own
  field than to your target. So the cover here is thin
  on purpose:
  {_SANCTUARY}  : {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} at Hatay, {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km. A
    bubble over the field and the pattern — cover for an
    approach, not for a fight. Anything wider would
    reach the front and the seam would stop mattering.
    {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a short hold abeam the field.
  {_REAR_SANCTUARY}   : {_REAR_BATTERY.name} at Incirlik, {_REAR_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, where
    Magic and Texaco come from. 105 km further back and
    properly covered. If Hatay is not an option, that is
    where you go; the field is a steerpoint in your
    cartridge.

**Theater:** Syria
**Date / time:** 12 September 2026, 08:40 local
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Uzi`), Hatay, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Uzi")}
**Difficulty:** trained (medium) — a 90 km front line with an S-125 battery on
each shoulder and a third in the southern rear, three layered SAM belts with
drilled EMCON-capable crews, an unlocated SA-11 covering the northern rear,
organic SHORAD on the target, an alert fighter pair, full support package
(AWACS, tanker, TARCAP, FAC(A))
**Expected sortie length:** ~60 minutes

## Situation

Overhead imagery before first light caught a Syrian resupply column forming at
Abu al-Duhur; a Reaper has been following it since and it is running
north-west toward the Taftanaz off-load. Partner-force reporting out of the
pocket says it carries the ammunition for the next push. It travels with its
own short-range air defence.

That ammunition is for the front line, and the line is between you and the
road. Ninety kilometres of dug-in Syrian positions run across the approach with
an S-125 battery holding each shoulder; the only sector without a battery on it
is the middle one, and the SA-6 covers that instead. There is no way to the
convoy that is not either through the seam or round a wing.

The ground behind the line is held ground, too — a third S-125 battery sits in
the southern rear level with the convoy road, and there is something in the
northern rear we could not put a pin in. Going round the line does not buy an
empty sky on the far side; it buys a different envelope, further from the tanker.

A Rivet Joint track overnight mapped the corridor it drives through: three
overlapping Russian-supplied SAM belts — an SA-2 belt around Abu al-Duhur, an
SA-6 belt on the high ground over the route, and a mobile SA-8 at the off-load
— tied together by early-warning radars sitting behind them.

## Mission

`Uzi` flight breaks the column up before it reaches Taftanaz. The convoy is the
objective; the SAM belts are the problem, not the target list. Kill what you
must, suppress the rest, and get weapons onto the trucks.

1. **Cross the line.** Push out of Hatay and cross at the seam, high — the
   frontage either side of it is guns and MANPADS, and each shoulder is an
   S-125 battery. Going round is a hundred-kilometre detour into one of them
   on a sortie that already needs the tanker.
2. **SEAD.** The seam puts you in the SA-6's sector, which is the point: the
   SA-6 on the ridge is what owns the convoy route — put it down or keep it
   down.
3. **Interdict.** Work the column with the CBU-97s — SFW submunitions are what
   kill a dispersed column in two passes, and they are on slot 2 rather than
   spread over both jets. `Hammer` (MQ-9) is overhead on
   {_FREQ_FAC}.000 AM for the talk-on, lasing code {_LASER_CODE}
   for `Pontiac`'s GBU-12s.
4. **Strike release.** `Pontiac` (2x F/A-18C) is held in reserve at Hatay and
   will run the column once the SAM threat over the route is suppressed.
5. **DCA.** Plan on the Bassel Al-Assad alert pair getting airborne at some
   point in the sortie — cockpit alert puts them minutes from the corridor.
   `Eagle` is on a barrier CAP down the corridor on our side of the line, so
   the alert pair has to come through them to reach you; back them up.

## How those crews handle a HARM

Every radar-guided site in the corridor is drilled in emissions control, and
the belts are netted — a launch anywhere on the corridor gets called down the
net. When they see an anti-radiation shot:

- the crew that hears the call usually drops emissions; not all of them do,
  and the SA-2 site is the least disciplined of the three;
- none of them gets a launch warning, so the shot has to be spotted, passed and
  believed before anyone touches the transmitter — that costs them the better
  part of a minute, and a shot taken from inside the belt arrives first and
  kills. Standoff buys the dark window; a close shot buys the radar;
- the site then sits dark with radars off and weapons tight for several
  minutes, and `Magic` calls the shutdown on the radio;
- keep the pressure on with a second shot and that crew stays off the air
  longer;
- when they judge it safe the radar comes back up, and `Magic` calls that too.

Both of those calls are `Magic`'s ESM watch, not a certainty. He hears an
antenna he has line of sight to, so a battery shielded from his track by high
ground can go quiet without anybody saying so — and if he is off station or off
the air, nobody is listening for you at all. Your own RWR is the primary.

Practical consequence: a HARM taken from standoff buys you a working window
rather than a kill, and the closer you shoot the more likely the emitter is
still up when the missile arrives. Plan the run for the window, and remember the
column's own launchers and guns never shut down — they are optical and
IR-guided.

### `Uzi` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Uzi", _FITS)}

The frag is two jobs and the flight carries one each. Slot 1 is the Weasel and
flies with four AMRAAM, because there is an alert pair at Bassel Al-Assad and
`Eagle` is a barrier behind the seam rather than an escort. Slot 2 carries four
CBU-97 on TERs — twice the submunitions a dispersed column needs — and the
LITENING to find it with.

Nothing `Uzi` carries rides a laser: the SFWs are self-guided and the pod is
there to look, not to designate for yourself. `Pontiac` carries 4x GBU-12 with
ATFLIR, coded `{_LASER_CODE}` — the code `Hammer` lases on, so the two need no
arranging.

## Intelligence

Positions below come off last night's Rivet Joint cut and this morning's
Reaper feed — the belts are located to a few kilometres, not to the metre, and
the map rings are marked as estimates for that reason. It is not a complete
picture, and the last bullet is there to say where it is thin.

{self.recon_figure_md()}

- **The line:** partner-force units are in contact along the whole frontage, so
  the trace on your map is good. Armour, 23 mm guns and Igla teams hold the
  sectors — a threat below about 10,000 ft and nothing above it — and each
  shoulder is an S-125 battery, roughly 25 km of reach with the ceiling to
  match. The seam in the middle is the sector with no battery on it.
- **The rear:** a third S-125 battery in the southern rear, level with the
  convoy road, roughly 25 km. Together with the belts below it there is no
  quarter of that airspace nobody is covering — assume the far side of the line
  is defended in depth, because it is.
- **Long belt:** SA-2 around Abu al-Duhur, reach out to roughly 40 km. Poorly
  drilled crew by the standard of the other two.
- **Medium belt:** SA-6 on the high ground over the convoy route, roughly
  25 km, and the belt that actually owns the road. The Straight Flush radar is
  the priority kill — the launchers are blind without it.
- **Short belt:** mobile SA-8 at the Taftanaz off-load, roughly 10 km. Sharp
  crew, and it will relocate.
- **Organic SHORAD:** the Reaper feed shows tracked IR launchers, a
  gun-missile vehicle and a Shilka in the column itself. Capable crews, and
  none of it can be suppressed with a HARM.
- **EWR:** early-warning radars behind the belts, holding the picture for the
  whole net. The batteries do not sit on the air waiting for you — they are
  handed a track and come up when you are close enough to be worth shooting
  at, so a quiet RWR early in the push is the net working, not the net being
  absent. Killing the search radars does not turn the belts off: a battery cut
  off from the net reverts to searching on its own, which means it radiates
  continuously from then on. That is worth doing — every belt becomes an
  emitter you can find and shoot, and nobody is being handed a hand-off any
  more — but it buys visibility, not silence.
- **Air:** ELINT puts a MiG-29S pair on cockpit alert at Bassel Al-Assad,
  experienced crews. Cockpit alert is minutes from the runway and the field is
  minutes from the corridor; whether they are released and when is the Syrian
  air-defence commander's call, so plan on the fight rather than on a warning.
- **Bassel Al-Assad field defence:** an S-125 battery on the alert pair's own
  airfield, with self-propelled guns in the overhead, and in the same net as the
  belts — it goes dark under a HARM like everything else. It is 102 km from the
  convoy road and reaches 18 km, so it touches no part of the run. It is the
  reason a MiG that turns for home stops being a target.
- **Not located:** a Gadfly-class search radar came up on the net in the
  northern rear overnight and we never got a fix on it. There is no ring for it
  on the map and no point for it on your cartridge, because we would be drawing
  a guess. Fly as though that flank is covered — it very likely is — and expect
  `Magic` to call it if it radiates while you are up and he can hear it.

## ROE

- Cleared to engage the convoy and every air-defence unit covering it.
- The front line is not the target. Two HARMs will not open a shoulder battery
  and the strongpoints belong to the partner force's fight — cross the seam and
  leave them be.
- Do not arc round the line. Both flanks are S-125 country, the rear behind
  them is covered as well, the northern one has an emitter we could not find,
  and the fuel is not there for the detour.
- Cleared to engage Syrian and Russian aircraft inside the corridor.
- HARM suppresses; a dark site is not a dead site. Do not loiter in a MEZ
  waiting for a radar that will come back up.
- A crew that never saw you shoot has nothing to react to — the missile is
  passive and warns nobody. Shoot from behind terrain where you can and the
  round arrives on a live emitter; shoot in plain view of the belt and you are
  racing their reaction time.
- Tank from `Texaco` before the push if SEAD runs long — F-16C internal fuel
  does not cover a 60-minute sortie plus a MEZ fight.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Bassel Al-Assad.** A withdrawing MiG is not
  worth an S-125, and it is 102 km the wrong way on the fuel you will have.
- Bingo fuel: 3500 lb. RTB Hatay, or Incirlik if Hatay will not do — see below.

## Fall-back

The cover on this sortie is deliberately thin at the front and solid at the
back, and the front line is what decides that. Hatay is a forward strip with ten
fighter stands, and the Syrian forward line stands **52 km** off its threshold —
closer to your own field than to your target.

- `{_SANCTUARY}` — a {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery at Hatay reaching {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, the
  smaller cyan ring, with gun sections in the overhead. That is cover for an
  approach, not cover for a fight: a wider battery here would reach the forward
  line and start shooting into the partner force's ground battle, which would
  make the seam you are briefed to cross irrelevant. `{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a
  short hold abeam the field, inside the bubble.
- `{_REAR_SANCTUARY}` — a {_REAR_BATTERY.name} battery at Incirlik reaching {_REAR_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, the larger
  ring, covering the field `Magic`, `Texaco` and `Eagle` work from. 105 km
  further back and properly held. If Hatay is not an option — weather, damage,
  a blocked runway — that is where you go. There is no marshal point there
  because nobody diverts in order to hold; the field is a steerpoint in your
  cartridge and a label on the map.

Neither battery will help you over the seam. What they do is make breaking off a
plan instead of a hope.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- PUSH: 25 km southeast of Hatay.
- SEAM: the crossing, straight on out of PUSH, about 26 km short of the convoy
  road and marked on the map. The front-line trace either side of it is drawn
  precisely — both armies have been sitting on it for weeks.
- Convoy axis: Abu al-Duhur → Taftanaz, north-west, ~28 km of road.
- Off-load: Taftanaz. If the column reaches it, we have missed the window.
- Your data cartridge carries the three belts and all three S-125 batteries as
  pre-planned threats — select PRE on the HSD (they show on the HAD too) for the
  rings. They are the same estimates the map shows, off the same cut, and no
  more precise than it.
- Two threats are deliberately **not** on the cartridge and have no ring on the
  map. The column's own SHORAD drives with the trucks, so a fixed envelope drawn
  where the column started would be a lie about everywhere it no longer covers —
  treat the whole convoy axis as short-range-SAM country and work it from
  outside 8 km. The unlocated Gadfly has no position at all, and a cartridge
  point is a claim we cannot make; the north being spoken for is the warning.

## Frequencies

- `{_SANCTUARY}` and `{_REAR_SANCTUARY}` details are on the kneeboard comms card.

- Magic AWACS: {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM — {_PRESET_AWACS}
- Texaco tanker: {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN 10X — {_PRESET_TANKER}
- Hammer FAC(A): {_FREQ_FAC}.000 AM — laser code {_LASER_CODE}
- Hatay tower: per kneeboard

`Hammer` works the VHF radio, not the UHF one the jet starts on: dial
{_FREQ_FAC}.000 AM into COMM2 and he appears in the radio menu as
**Hammer 1-1**. Until COMM2 is on his net there is no JTAC entry to select.

`Hammer`'s formal nine-line comes over in military grid — that is how the net
reads it, and the DED cannot take it. He also passes the column in degrees and
decimal minutes with the ground elevation: once shortly after check-in, and again
whenever you ask for it (F10 radio menu → *Other* → **Hammer 1-1** → *Target
coordinates*). The column is on the move, so the position is only good when you
ask for it — get a fresh one before the run-in rather than flying the one from
check-in.

## Weather

Late-summer Levant haze: 30 °C, QNH 760 mmHg, light west wind, 25 km
visibility, few clouds at 3000 m.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Primary success:** the column is rendered combat-ineffective short of
  Taftanaz — enough of it wrecked that the ammunition never gets through.
- **Full success:** the whole column destroyed and the alert pair defeated.
- **Failure:** the column reaches the Taftanaz off-load.

        The tuned dials are the difficulty statement for the SEAD half of this
        mission, and they run in two halves.

        **When a site is on the air.** Only the EWR chain radiates from the
        start — that is its job, and it is the trip wire the whole gauntlet
        hangs off. Every battery sits dark until the chain hands it a track
        inside its own reach, so the run out of Hatay is quiet, the RWR fills
        in belt by belt as the package works up the corridor, and a site the
        player never flew near never announces itself. Each `go_live_percent`
        is over 100 on purpose: a battery that waits until the target is inside
        its launch envelope comes up and watches, because a DCS site needs
        something like half a minute from cold to a shot.

        Two consequences the mission wants. The unlocated Gadfly stays off the
        air until somebody is well into the northern arc, so it is an ambush
        rather than a strobe the player could have avoided. And killing the EWR
        chain does not switch the belts off — a battery cut off from the net
        goes to autonomous search, which is doctrine, so it radiates
        continuously from then on. That is a trade rather than a win: no more
        layered hand-off and every belt is now an emitter you can find, but
        nothing is dark any more either.

        **How a site reacts to being shot at.** Nobody gets a launch warning
        from a passive missile, so every band is tens of seconds — the same
        order as a HARM's flight — and the shot's range decides the duel: the
        SA-8's own crew works its own radar and is off the air in well under a
        minute, the drilled SA-6 crew not far behind, the conscript SA-2 belt
        misses the call almost a third of the time and takes over a minute when
        it does, and the EWRs — furthest from the shooter, and not the ones
        being shot at — react slowest and come back up soonest. A suppressed
        site stays dark ~4–6 min, long enough that a HARM buys the package a
        real run at the column instead of a one-minute gap.

        The `net_relay` values say who is trusted to call a launch nobody local
        saw. The belts are on the same net and take each other's word readily;
        the rear-area batteries, 45 km or more off the corridor, are told about
        a shot at somebody else and mostly carry on regardless.

        **Who reports it.** `Magic` is the only listener, so the emissions calls
        the briefing promises are his ESM watch and nobody else's. That is the
        honest chain — the E-3A is the one thing airborne here with a receiver
        looking at those belts, the Rivet Joint cut the Intelligence section
        quotes was flown overnight and is long gone — and it makes the calls
        conditional on him: a battery on the far side of a ridge from his track,
        or anything at all once he is dead or off station, goes dark without a
        word. The player's own RWR still shows what it always showed.
