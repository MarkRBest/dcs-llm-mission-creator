"""Caucasus 'Coastal Cover' — F-16C swing-role escort over the Inguri valley.

The player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Batumi on a sortie that changes shape
three times, and the mission is the seams between the shapes rather than any one
of them:

1. **Escort.** Push the terrain-masked corridor, station over the AO, and keep
   the Russian alert pair off `Hawg` — the A-10C pair fragged against the
   armoured column on the valley road.
2. **Strike.** The column is the escort for what the march is actually for: a
   fuel and ammunition detachment a dozen kilometres back down the same road,
   in the rear of the march. `Hawg` is dry
   on the column by the time it matters, so the GBU-12s under `Dodge`'s striker
   are the only thing in the package that can stop it — talked on and lased by
   `Pinpoint 1-1`, a tactical air control party in the treeline above the road.
3. **Defending the man doing the lasing.** A Russian battalion works out where a
   laser is coming from, and the counter is not another SAM: it is a pair of
   Mi-24Ps sent low up the valley after `Pinpoint`. Losing that race costs the
   player the laser rather than the mission — the pod self-designates — but it
   costs the pass its margin, and it is a low, slow, look-down fight the rest of
   the sortie never asks for.

Two things are deliberately absent from the F10 map, the cartridge and every
friendly flight plan, and both are named as gaps in the briefing rather than
sprung (the rules for that are in the `dcs-mission` skill):

- **the SA-8 travelling with the detachment.** The briefing says a brigade's
  fuel does not move without air defence and that nobody found it, and it gives
  a hard release floor — 6,000 m, above the system's ceiling — so the withheld
  launcher punishes the greedy low pass and not the briefed plan. `Magic` names
  it on ESM when it radiates.
- **the Su-27 pair at Gudauta**, which is `Eagle`'s and is named as `Eagle`'s in
  both briefings and on the radio when it scrambles.

`Dodge` carries four air-to-air missiles and two bombs, so the frag is priced
against that magazine rather than against the airspace: **nothing airborne is a
required kill.** The arithmetic is in `_spawn_red_escalation`.

Composition (difficulty: trained):
  - Russian armoured column `Convoy Bear` (4x BTR-80, 2x T-72B, 1x ZSU-23-4) on
    a snap-on-road route from the Inguri valley to the Senaki junction.
  - Second echelon in the rear of the same march: `POL Bear` (2x ATZ-10
    bowser + 1x Ural-375 — the player's target), a BTR-80 escort, and one
    SA-8 Osa that joins the road when the party calls the trucks.
  - 2x SA-13 (Strela-10M3) on high ground overlooking the road, Skill.High.
  - 2x ZSU-23-4 AAA overwatch on the valley hills.
  - 2x T-72B + 2x BTR-80 counterattack reserve concealed behind the column.
  - 2x 55G6 EWR chain along the Russian frontier for GCI vectoring.
  - 2x MiG-29S `Boris` at Sukhumi-Babushara, Skill.High, launched on intrusion.
  - 2x Su-27 `Sokol` at Gudauta, Skill.Average, cold on the ramp until the
    column comes apart — a threat to survive, not a tasked kill.
  - 2x Mi-24P `Krokodil`, low up the valley after the TACP team, sent once the
    detachment has been seen and lased.
  - An S-125 battery with gun sections over Sukhumi-Babushara, so a MiG that
    turns for home stops being a target.
  - USAF support: E-3A `Magic`, KC-135 `Texaco` (TACAN 10X), F-15C `Eagle` CAP,
    A-10C `Hawg` on the column, `Pinpoint 1-1` TACP lasing the detachment, and
    a Hawk battery (`BULLDOG`) over Batumi to run to.
  - Weather: spring scattered cumulus, light NW wind, 18 C.

========================================================
SITUATION
  A Reaper feed at first light watched a Russian
  mechanised column form up in the Inguri valley and
  start south on the valley road toward Senaki. That
  column is the escort. The load is behind it — the same
  feed counted a fuel and ammunition detachment forming
  up in the rear of the march, and that is what puts a
  brigade back on the road once it reaches the Senaki
  junction. USAF A-10s (Hawg 1-2) out of Kutaisi are
  fragged against the column. Nobody is fragged against
  the detachment except you.
  Russian fighters at Sukhumi-Babushara went to alert on
  the same warning — expect them airborne once we commit.

MISSION (Dodge — F-16C-50, Batumi)
  1. ESCORT. Push north along the terrain-masked
     corridor, station over the AO and keep the Russian
     alert pair off Hawg's run.
  2. STRIKE. GBU-12 for the fuel detachment when it comes
     down the valley road. Pinpoint 1-1 has eyes on the
     road and holds the spot from the moment the trucks
     are in his sight line — no check-in, no talk-on to
     sit through on the run-in. Bombs and spot are both
     on code {_LASER_CODE}; the pod comes up there too.
     The bombs are on slot 1 only — see LOADOUT.
  3. COVER PINPOINT. He is three vehicles in a treeline
     and he is the reason two bombs are enough.

LOADOUT (the flight splits the frag)
{self.loadout_brief("Dodge", _FITS)}
  Slot 1 flies the strike; slot 2 carries no bomb and
  two more missiles, and covers the run-in.

PACKAGE
  Dodge        : F-16C-50 pair, Batumi, hot ramp. Loadout
                 above.
  Hawg 1-2     : A-10C, Kutaisi, strike on the column.
  Eagle 1-2    : F-15C CAP toward Sukhumi. Eagle owns
                 the air-to-air fight — one of you is
                 carrying bombs and the other is one jet.
  Magic        : E-3A AWACS, {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM.
  Texaco       : KC-135, {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN {_TANKER_TACAN},
                 west of Batumi over the water.
  Pinpoint 1-1 : TACP in the valley, {_FREQ_TACP}.000 AM,
                 lases on code {_LASER_CODE}, spot up
                 whenever the trucks are in his sight.

INTELLIGENCE
  Air : Sukhumi-Babushara holds a MiG-29S pair on alert,
        current generation missiles. A Rivet Joint track
        overnight fixed early-warning radars along the
        frontier — they will see you coming and vector.
        Gudauta holds a second pair, Su-27, and we assess
        they commit only if the column is coming apart.
        That pair is Eagle's. You are not required to
        kill it and you are cleared to leave it flying.
  SAM : The Reaper feed showed a tracked SHORAD launcher
        moving onto high ground overlooking the road.
        SA-13 class, IR, short reach. Stay above 4000 m
        AGL over the target box and it cannot touch you.
        Sukhumi-Babushara itself is defended — an S-125
        battery on the field and guns in the overhead.
        Do not follow anyone home.
        THE GAP: a detachment carrying a brigade's fuel
        does not travel without air defence, and we never
        found it. No ring on your map because we would be
        drawing a guess. Release the bombs from 6000 m or
        above and nothing that size reaches you; go down
        to look at the trucks and you are inside whatever
        is driving with them.
  AAA : Gun vehicles ride with the column, and the same
        imagery showed dug-in guns on the hills either
        side of the valley road.
  Land: Partner-force reporting puts a small armoured
        reserve laagered in the treeline behind the
        column, held back to push through if the lead
        elements are hit. Unconfirmed.
  Heli: Russian rotary is based up the Inguri. If they
        work out where the laser is coming from, that is
        what they will send, and it will come low.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Hold fire on civilian/neutral contacts.
  - Cleared to engage any Russian aircraft entering the AO.
  - Do not overfly the convoy below 4000 m AGL.
  - LGB release at or above 6000 m, outside 8 km slant.
  - Not cleared to pursue over Sukhumi-Babushara.
  - Bingo fuel: 2500 lb. Texaco first, then RTB Batumi.

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY})
  Batumi is covered by a {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery —
  {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, cyan ring on the map, with guns in
  the overhead. If you are hit, out of missiles or out
  of fuel, that ring is the answer: get inside it and
  the fight is over. {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a hold
  abeam the field, in the DED and on the map. Kutaisi
  is a divert but it is outside the ring.

NAV
  Bullseye (own side): {bx:.0f}, {by:.0f} (DCS world m)
  AO center         : ~18 km north-northeast of Senaki.
  PUSH waypoint     : 25 km north of Batumi (corridor IP).
  ECHELON steerpoint: the stretch of valley road Pinpoint
                      is watching. The detachment's own
                      position is his to pass, not ours —
                      F10 -> Other -> Pinpoint 1-1 reads it
                      out in your cockpit's own format.
                      His nine-line is a military grid, as
                      DCS reads it to every airframe; that
                      menu entry is what the DED will take.
  Cartridge         : the SHORAD estimate and the Sukhumi belt
                      are loaded as pre-planned threats — select
                      PRE on the HSD for the rings. They are
                      where the feed and the signals work last
                      had them, not fixes.
  Imagery           : the Reaper's radar cut of the column is
                      on the briefing screen, shot 25 minutes

**Theater:** Caucasus
**Date / time:** 15 May 2026, 10:00 local
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Dodge`), Batumi, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Dodge")}
**Difficulty:** trained — experienced MiG-29S pair on alert and a second-line
Su-27 pair behind them, current-generation missiles, GCI vectoring, SHORAD over
the target and one unlocated launcher with the second echelon, rotary threat
against the ground party, AWACS + tanker support, a covered field to run to
**Expected sortie length:** ~60 minutes (of which a good ten are spent waiting
for the second echelon to come down the road)

## Situation

A Reaper feed at first light watched a Russian mechanised column form up in
the Inguri valley and start south on the valley road toward Senaki. That
column is the escort. The load is behind it: the same feed counted a fuel and
ammunition detachment forming up in the rear of the march, and that detachment
is what puts a brigade back on the road once it reaches the junction north of
Senaki.

USAF A-10s (`Hawg 1-2`) out of Kutaisi are fragged against the column. Nobody
is fragged against the detachment except `Dodge`. Russian fighters at
Sukhumi-Babushara went to alert on the same warning — expect them airborne once
the package commits.

## Mission

Three tasks, in the order the sortie will hand them to you.

1. **Escort.** Push north along the terrain-masked ingress corridor, take
   station over the AO, and keep the Russian alert pair off `Hawg`'s run.
2. **Strike.** GBU-12 for the fuel detachment when it comes down the valley
   road. `Pinpoint 1-1` — a tactical air control party in the treeline above
   the road — has eyes on it and will lase on code `{_LASER_CODE}`. The bombs
   are coded `{_LASER_CODE}` as well, and the pod comes up on it, so nothing
   needs retuning to take his spot. **He holds that spot whenever the trucks
   are in his sight line, whether or not you have spoken to him** — you come
   out of a masked corridor onto a moving target, and a check-in and a talk-on
   would cost more of the window than the pass does. His net is there for the
   talk-on and the coordinates if you want them, not as a precondition for the
   laser. When the road bends behind the spur the spot goes out, and he says
   so. **The bombs are on slot 1**; see the loadout table below for who is
   carrying what.
3. **Cover `Pinpoint`.** He is three vehicles in a treeline, he is the reason
   two bombs are enough for a moving detachment, and the Russians will work out
   where the laser is coming from.

### `Dodge` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Dodge", _FITS)}

The flight splits the frag rather than compromising on one jet. Stations 3 and
7 are the only ones that take a bomb once the bags are on 4 and 6, so a Viper
with the GBU-12s has four air-to-air missiles and a Viper without them has six
— and this sortie needs both numbers at once. Slot 1 flies the strike and is the
jet `Pinpoint` is talking to; slot 2 carries no ordnance for the ground at all
and covers the run-in, which is the ten minutes the flight spends slow and low
over a valley with a rotary threat in it.

Two bombs against three trucks is still the tension: **one striker carries
two**, and only a four-slot flight puts a second striker up. `Eagle` still owns
the air-to-air fight, and nothing airborne is a required kill in this frag.
`Texaco` is on station because the jets launch heavy and then loiter — the fuel
goes on waiting for the second echelon, not on the transit.

## Intelligence

The ground picture below is one Reaper that has been over the Inguri valley
since first light — the column, the launcher and the hill guns are all off that
feed, and the column is located to the road it is driving on. The hill
positions are good to a kilometre or two, which is why the map rings are marked
as estimates. The air and radar picture is not from the feed at all: that is
overnight signals work, and the reserve is partner-force reporting nobody has
confirmed.

{self.recon_figure_md()}

- **Air:** Sukhumi-Babushara holds a MiG-29S pair on alert, current-generation
  missiles, flown by an experienced crew. They will come once we are committed
  over the valley. Gudauta holds a second pair, Su-27, and the assessment is
  that they commit only once the column is coming apart. **That pair is
  `Eagle`'s.** You are not required to kill it and you are cleared to leave it
  flying.
- **EWR:** A Rivet Joint track overnight fixed early-warning radars along the
  Russian frontier. Assume the pair is vectored onto you from the moment you
  cross the coast.
- **SAM:** The Reaper feed showed a tracked SHORAD launcher moving onto high
  ground overlooking the road — SA-13 class, IR-guided, short reach. Stay
  above 4000 m AGL over the target box and it cannot reach you.
- **The gap:** a detachment carrying a brigade's fuel does not travel without
  air defence, and we never found it. There is **no ring on your map for it,
  because we would be drawing a guess.** What the arithmetic says is that
  nothing in that weight class reaches 6000 m: release at or above that and
  outside 8 km slant and it is not your problem. Go down for a look at the
  trucks and it is.
- **Sukhumi-Babushara field defence:** the same overnight signals work that
  found the frontier radars puts an S-125 battery on the airfield, with
  self-propelled guns in the overhead. Short reach and it covers nothing you
  need — but it is the reason a MiG that turns for home stops being a target.
- **AAA:** Gun vehicles ride with the column, and the same imagery showed
  dug-in guns on the hills either side of the valley road.
- **Land reserve:** Partner-force reporting puts a small armoured reserve
  laagered in the treeline behind the column, held back to push through if the
  lead elements are hit. Unconfirmed.
- **Rotary:** Russian attack helicopters are based up the Inguri. If they work
  out where the laser is coming from, that is what they will send, and it will
  come low up the valley where the radar picture is worst.

## ROE

- Hold fire on civilian / neutral contacts.
- Cleared to engage any Russian aircraft entering the AO.
- Do not overfly the convoy below 4000 m AGL.
- **LGB release at or above 6000 m, outside 8 km slant.** That is the answer to
  the launcher nobody found, and it is a hard number rather than advice.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Sukhumi-Babushara.** A withdrawing MiG is not
  worth an S-125.
- The Su-27 pair is a threat to survive, not a target list. Disengaging from it
  is a correct decision, not a failed one.
- Bingo fuel: 2500 lb. Texaco first, then RTB Batumi (divert: Kutaisi).

## Fall-back

Batumi is covered by a `{_SANCTUARY}` {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery —
{_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, drawn as the cyan ring on the F10
map — with gun sections in the overhead. That ring is where the sortie stops
being dangerous: if you are hit, out of missiles or below bingo, run for it
rather than turning back into a fight you have already lost. `{_SANCTUARY}
MARSHAL` is a hold abeam the field inside the envelope, on the map and in the
DED, for sorting out a damaged jet or waiting on the pattern.

Kutaisi is a legal divert but it is 97 km from Batumi and **outside** the
envelope — treat it as a runway, not as cover.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- AO center: ~18 km north-northeast of Senaki.
- PUSH waypoint: 25 km north of Batumi (corridor IP).
- ECHELON steerpoint: the stretch of valley road `Pinpoint` is watching. The
  detachment's own position is his to pass, not ours — **F10 → Other →
  Pinpoint 1-1** reads it out in your own cockpit's format, off a live vehicle,
  so it is current for something that is still driving. DCS's own nine-line
  will read you a military grid whatever you are flying; that entry is what
  gives an F-16 driver something the DED will take.
- Your route is a terrain-masked corridor that keeps ridgelines between you
  and the reported launcher and radar positions for as long as it can.
- Your data cartridge carries the SHORAD estimate and the Sukhumi belt as
  pre-planned threats — select PRE on the HSD for the rings. They mark where
  the feed and the signals work last had them, which is the same claim the map
  makes, not a fix.

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM
- Texaco tanker: {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN {_TANKER_TACAN}
- Pinpoint 1-1: {_FREQ_TACP}.000 AM
- Batumi tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` details, the laser code and the divert are on the kneeboard
  comms card.

## Weather

Spring scattered cumulus, light NW wind, 18 °C. QNH 760 mmHg. Visibility
80 km. Scattered layer at 2400 m, 600 m thick.

## Win / loss conditions

Layered, and the second layer is the one only `Dodge` can do.

- **Primary:** the Russian column is broken up on the valley road and never
  reaches the Senaki junction.
- **Secondary:** the fuel and ammunition detachment behind it is stopped short
  of the same junction. This is the player's task — `Hawg` is dry on the column
  by the time it matters.
- **Full success:** both, with `Pinpoint` still on the air at the end of it.
- **Failure:** `Hawg` is shot down with the column still rolling, or the
  detachment reaches the junction and off-loads.

Losing `Pinpoint` is a real cost rather than a failure: the talk-on and the
laser go with him, and the pass has to be flown self-designating.

        """The load the whole march is for: bowsers, an escort, and an SA-8.

        Three groups rather than one, and the split is most of what the second
        half of this mission is made of:

        - `POL Bear` holds only what the frag names — two ATZ-10 bowsers and an
          ammunition truck — so a two-bomb magazine is measured against three
          soft trucks and not against an escort nobody asked the player to kill.
        - the BTR-80 is its own group, so killing it neither counts toward the
          objective nor spares the trucks.
        - the SA-8 is its own group for two reasons. Inside the objective's
          group `Pinpoint` would lase it along with the bowsers and it would need
          a ring on the plan — and a ring is the one thing this launcher must not
          have (see `_draw_plan`). Being separate is also what lets it be
          **late-activated**, which is the fix for a real defect in the first
          version of this mission: emplaced from mission start it began the
          sortie 10 km north of the AO and drove south through it, so an Osa
          nobody was briefed on was inside `Hawg`'s 4,000 m run on the column at
          about T+17. A withheld threat that breaks the *briefed* plan is a bug
          wearing a fog-of-war costume; this one has to bite the player's own low
          pass and nothing else. It comes on the road at
          `_OSA_ROUTE_FRACTION` — where the trucks are when `Pinpoint` calls
          them, about T+16 — so it exists only from the moment the player is told
          the detachment exists, and by then `Hawg` has made its run and is
          egressing. It still ends up within reach of the AO later, on the road,
          which is correct: an Osa escorting fuel would shoot at an A-10 it could
          see. What it can no longer do is be there before anybody was told.

        The trucks and their escort roll from mission start rather than being
        activated on approach: a late-activated group is a group that does not
        exist when the FAC task and the coordinate readout bind to it, and the
        reveal activation would have bought is bought instead by
        `_add_echelon_sighting_trigger`. The detachment is concealed like every
        other Russian group here, so what the player knows about it is what
        `Pinpoint` tells him — which is also the honest answer to how anybody
        knows.

        This is the answer to a player who solves the strike problem *correctly*.
        `Pinpoint`'s laser is what makes two GBU-12s enough against a moving
        detachment, and a Russian battalion works out where a laser is coming
        from the same way anyone would — so the counter is not another SAM, it is
        a pair of gunships hunting a three-vehicle team in a treeline.

        What that buys the sortie is a threat in a part of the sky nothing else
        here uses: low, slow, in the ground clutter, inside the valley the player
        has spent the whole mission staying above. And losing the race costs the
        laser rather than the mission — the F-16C can self-designate with the
        pod, at the price of flying the pass itself.

        Spawned in the air, and the docstring should say why rather than pretend:
        a pair like this comes off a forward FARP up the Inguri, the mission does
        not model one, and what it does model is that they are not there at push
        and are *called* as they come.

        The spawn is 22 km up the valley from the party rather than deep in the
        range, and that is a timing decision. At 250 km/h every ten kilometres is
        two and a half minutes; the first attempt put them 52 km out at 2,300 m
        in the high Caucasus, which arrived a quarter of an hour after the flag —
        i.e. after the strike it is supposed to complicate. Five minutes plus the
        four `_HIND_DELAY_S` buys is a threat during the pass.

        `alt_type = "RADIO"` is the detail that makes the route flyable. Every
        other altitude in pydcs is metres AMSL, so 80 m AMSL up a valley whose
        floor is at 300 m is a route into the hillside; the spawn point has no
        preceding waypoint to ramp from, so that one is AMSL off the elevation
        raster instead.

        This is what makes two bombs enough. A moving detachment on a road is a
        hard LGB problem for a single jet with no wingman to buddy-lase, and the
        honest fix is not a bigger magazine — it is a controller on the ground
        who can see the road, talk the pilot on and hold a spot on a truck.
        `core/tasking.fac_attack_group` does the lasing and the talk-on;
        `_add_tacp_readout` adds the one thing DCS gets wrong for this airframe,
        which is reading a military grid to a cockpit that takes degrees and
        decimal minutes.

        `FacCallsign.PINPOINT` rather than the group name: a DCS FAC answers to
        its index in the game's own callname table, so a group called `Pinpoint`
        left on the default index checks in as *Axeman 1-1* and every line of the
        briefing is then wrong (see `core/tasking.FacCallsign`).

        `observation_post` rather than `place_ambush_on_route`, and the difference
        is the whole feature: the ambush helper picks concealment near a road and
        says nothing about sight lines, and the spot it chose here sat 830 m from
        the march route, 38 m *below* it and behind a rise — a controller who
        checks in, talks the player on and never lases, which from the cockpit
        looks like a mission bug. Line of sight to the road is a hard filter, and
        it is asked for at two points 4 km apart rather than at one; see
        `_TACP_WATCH_FRACTIONS` for what that difference is worth here.

        Deliberately **not** `SetInvisibleCommand`. An airborne FAC over a MEZ
        gets that treatment because the alternative is losing the laser in the
        first two minutes to something the player cannot fight; a ground party in
        a treeline is a different bargain — it is survivable, it is findable, and
        making it killable is what gives `_spawn_red_hinds` something to hunt and
        the player something to defend. It sits near the road because a JTAC
        lases what its own sensor sees, not what the mission tells it about.

        Every intelligence line in this briefing is sourced to one Reaper that
        has been over the Inguri valley since first light — the column forming
        up, the launcher going onto high ground, the guns on the hills. This is
        the one thing that feed can actually be shown doing: a wide-area cut of
        the column on the valley road, stamped shortly before push, so the
        picture is the column where the mission puts it rather than where it was
        five hours ago.

        `plan.detections` is the reveal gate, so the still cannot out-claim the
        F10 map, and at `veteran`/`ace` it returns nothing and no frame is
        published. Only the column is marked. The launcher on the high ground
        and the dug-in guns are a ring and an icon on the map instead: at 50 m
        posts a gun pit is a fifth of a pixel, and bracketing one here would be
        a third, better-looking estimate of a site the map and the cartridge
        already place — three claims about one launcher, disagreeing.

        Returns are laid along the real road by `road_column` rather than read
        off the group: pydcs stacks a platoon abeam its heading and DCS only
        strings it out along the road once the mission runs, so the build-time
        positions are a dash at right angles to the road the briefing names.

        The 1.2 km registration bias `detections` defaults to is cut to 200 m
        because this frame paints roads and braided river to register against —
        see that method on why the number is calibration and not a difficulty
        concession. Measured here, the default put the column 1.0–1.2 km from

        The stock spot comes up inside a radio conversation the player has to be
        in range and in line of sight of, and this sortie is written so he is
        neither: the ingress is a terrain-masked corridor, and he comes out of it

        burning. Nothing here reads the player at all.
