"""Caucasus 'Kuban Forge' — F-16C ace strike on a rocket-motor plant, low ingress.

Player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Senaki-Kolkhi as `Colt`. The target is a
Soviet-era chemical works on the Kuban north of Karachayevsk, re-tooled to cast
solid rocket motors for the batteries the rest of this theater keeps running
into. The plant sits in a valley, which is the point: it cannot be seen from
altitude, and the airspace over it belongs to a Buk battery on the plain.

The sortie carries **no anti-radiation weapon**. That is the design statement:
the SAM belts here cannot be shot, only avoided, so the terrain is the SEAD —
north-west across the Kolkheti lowland and the Abkhaz coastal plain, inland up
the Kodori valley system, over the **Klukhori Pass** onto the northern slope,
down the Teberda and out into the Kuban. Measured against the elevation raster,
the whole corridor is masked from the Buk and from both early-warning radars
until `KARACHAY`, where the Teberda turns toward the Kuban 34 km short of the
battery (`_CORRIDOR`, `waypoints.agl_profile`). Egress inverts the profile: the
valley bought surprise and the halls spend it, so the way home is a hard climb
south-west over the range and feet wet past the Abkhaz coast.

Three objectives, priced separately (`_add_end_triggers`):

  1. the two casting halls at the works — the frag, and what the two GBU-38s
     are aboard for, off a surveyed steerpoint each;
  2. the night's shipment, which leaves the loading yard the moment the field
     hears the raid coming and drives north up the Kuban. `Ferret`, a recon
     team on the ridge, calls it and lases it; catching it costs bombs the
     halls may still need, and the road it is on runs into the one battery
     nobody could fix;
  3. getting home. The alert section at Mineralnye Vody launches when the halls
     go up, and the climb out of the valley is flown inside the Buk's ring.

Composition (difficulty: ace):
  - SA-11 Buk site on the plain 14 km north of the works (Skill Excellent),
    the reason there is no approach above the ridges.
  - S-125 battery on the works itself (Skill High) + 2x 2S6 Tunguska and
    2x ZSU-23-4 inside the wire (Skill High / Average).
  - 2x 55G6 EWR — one on the plain feeding GCI, one in the western foothills
    watching the egress.
  - 2x Igla MANPADS teams in the Teberda valley (Skill Average) — the price of
    being predictable on the low route.
  - 1x SA-6 battery on the plain north of the Kuban bend, **on no map and in no
    cartridge**: the briefing names the gap, `Magic` calls the emitter when the
    player goes north, and it only bites somebody who chases the shipment past
    the bend.
  - A Russian MiG-29S alert section at Mineralnye Vody — a pair up to two coop
    slots, a four-ship above that — cold on the ramp and scrambled when the
    first casting hall goes up. Deliberately **not** a tasked kill.
  - Every radar-guided site is in one Skynet net (`core/iads.py`): nothing
    radiates until the early-warning chain hands it a track, which is what
    makes the valley run worth flying.
  - USA support: E-3A `Magic` (251.000 AM) and KC-135 `Texaco` (253.000 AM,
    TACAN 12X), both south of the watershed. No escort and no SEAD element —
    the flight covers itself, which is what its second fit is for.
  - Weather: October sunrise, broken layer based at 4500 m — six hundred
    metres over the Klukhori crossing, and the egress climbs through it.

#: and splitting the two across the file is how they drift apart. On an

#: The ingress corridor: north-west across the Kolkheti lowland and the Abkhaz
#: coastal plain, inland up the Kodori valley system, over the **Klukhori Pass**
#: and down the Teberda into the Kuban. `(name, lat, lng, height above the
#: ground, commanded TAS in km/h)` — degrees rather than DCS metres because
#: every one of these is a real place, and a coordinate you can put on a map is
#: a coordinate somebody can check. `daryal_run` learned that the expensive way:
#: a route written in raw map metres shipped with two valley waypoints inside a
#: mountainside, one of them by 2.7 km, and nothing about reading
#: `Point(-200000, 863000)` says "mountain".
#:
#: **600 m over the valley floor, not 200**, and the number is measured rather

#: every straight leg out of the rock — the Klukhori saddle is 3,000 m with
#: 3,400 m walls a kilometre either side, and a jet cannot thread that in the
#: three or four points a cartridge can spare. At 600 m it needs eleven, and
#: measured against the elevation raster it is still masked from the Buk and
#: from both early-warning radars at every point down to `KARACHAY` — where the
#: Teberda turns toward the Kuban, 34 km short of the battery. The masking here

#: high, fast and outside the Buk's ring in two and a half minutes. It is also

#: whole budget for a single-slot sortie. And **doctrine**: a field scrambles
#: what it has sitting on alert, which is a section, not a regiment. So this
#: goes to four and stops, rather than tracking `--players` upward into a sky
#: nobody could clear. It does not need to track it, because the MiGs are

_ALERT_SECTION = (2, 4)

#: Senaki's own air defence. `Colt` goes 181 km with no escort and no Weasel, and the one thing that makes turning for home a plan rather than a

#: How `Colt` splits the frag across its slots (`core/loadout.py`).
#:
#: **Four bombs stay four bombs**, and that is the point of the split rather
#: than an accident of it. Two casting halls, a shipment that rolls when the
#: field hears the raid, and one magazine to spend across both is the decision
#: this mission is built on — so the second jet does not carry a fifth bomb. It
#: carries the air-to-air fit, because the other half of the sortie is a climb
#: out of the Teberda inside the Buk's ring with a MiG-29S alert section
#: launching off the halls going up, and the briefing has always said there is
#: no escort coming.
#:
#: **Two weapons, because there are two kinds of target, and the difference is
#: whether the thing moves.** The halls are buildings. They were on the
#: 1:100,000 sheet before the war, they will be at the same coordinate
#: tomorrow, and `Ferret` has been looking at them for six days — so each one
#: is its own surveyed steerpoint (`_route_colt`) and each is serviced with a
#: satellite-aided bomb off that coordinate, with nobody holding a spot over a
#: valley an S-125 and two Tunguskas are sitting in. The shipment is the
#: opposite case: it is doing 40 km/h up the Kuban by the time anybody reaches
#: it, a JDAM cannot be given a coordinate for that, and it is exactly what a
#: controller on the ground with a designator is for. GPS for what does not
#: move, laser for what does; the fit is that sentence and nothing else.
#:
#: **A GBU-12 on a casting hall was the earlier answer and it was the wrong
#: one.** Not because it would not level the building — because a 500 lb laser
#: bomb is a vehicle weapon that happens to be legal against a structure, and
#: choosing it made the hall inherit the column's delivery: a spot, a talk-on,
#: and a target point drawn where the works were *assessed* to be. What goes
#: aboard instead is the smallest JDAM rather than the 2,000 lb penetrator
#: `ansariyah_works` carries, and that is a counting constraint rather than a
#: judgement about the target: two halls need two bombs, the BRU-57 is what
#: fits two on one station, and the other station is owed to the column.
#:
#: A four-slot flight puts a second bomber up and the decision softens; a pair
#: flies the sortie as written, with somebody covering the egress.
#:
#: The air-to-air fit is an ED payload station for station, off
#: `<DCS>/CoreMods/aircraft/F-16C/UnitPayloads/F-16C_50.lua`
#: (`AIM-120C*4, AIM-9X*2, FUEL*2, ECM, TGP`). The strike fit is two halves of
#: two of them: ED hangs the BRU-57 on 3 and the TER on 7 in its own loads, and
#: `core/loadout_check.py` reports nothing against either station. Both jets
#: keep this mission's one deliberate substitution — the pod is the AN/AAQ-33
#: rather than the LITENING, because the talk-on with `Ferret` happens at 600 m
#: over a valley floor and this mission picked the better sensor for it.

==================================================
SITUATION
  The chemical works on the Kuban north of
  Karachayevsk have been casting solid rocket
  motors since the spring. Every battery this
  theater has run into for six months has been
  fed from that valley. Two casting halls do the
  work; everything else on the site can be
  rebuilt in a fortnight.

  The works are in a valley because that is where
  they were built to be. There is no approach to
  them above the ridges: a Buk battery on the
  plain north of the site owns that airspace out
  to about 35 km, and you carry nothing that will
  argue with it. What you have instead is the
  ground. North-west over the Kolkheti flats and
  the Abkhaz coast, inland up the Kodori, over
  the Klukhori Pass and down the Teberda. Six
  hundred metres over the valley floor is enough
  — it is the massif doing the work, not the last
  three hundred feet. Nothing on the far side
  sees you until the Teberda turns toward the
  Kuban, about 34 km short of the battery.

MISSION (Colt — F-16C-50, Senaki, hot ramp)
  - Take Texaco before you turn north-west. You
    want full internal fuel at the coast, not at
    the ramp.
  - Feet dry over the Abkhaz plain low and quick.
    Everything from Ochamchira on is theirs.
  - Inland up the Kodori and over Klukhori at
    3,000 m of rock — you cross at about 3,900,
    six hundred under the layer. Hold 600 over
    the floor and do not crest a ridge to save a
    turn.
  - Down the Teberda. You will be seen somewhere
    around Karachayevsk; from there it is two and
    a half minutes to the pop, so be ready before
    you are detected, not after.
  - Pop at IP. Kill BOTH casting halls. Two long
    sheds in line, north-south, in the middle of
    the yard and west of the tank farm. You have
    a steerpoint on each of them, HALL A then
    HALL B, surveyed and 220 m apart — the JDAM
    fly to those numbers and need no spot. Ferret
    talks you on.
  - The night's shipment is loaded and will roll
    the moment they hear you coming. If you have
    bombs left, it is worth more than the tank
    farm is. Ferret lases it, code {_LASER_CODE} — the
    same code your two GBU-12s are on. The JDAM
    cannot chase it; the laser bombs are what it
    is there for.
  - Egress is a CLIMB, south-west, hard. You will
    be inside the Gadfly's ring for about two and
    a half minutes and there is no low way out of
    that valley once the halls are burning. Over
    the range, feet wet, home.
  - Do NOT go north past the Kuban bend.
  - RTB Senaki. Divert: Kutaisi.

LOADOUT (four bombs: two JDAM, two laser)
{self.loadout_brief("Colt", _FITS)}
  No HARM anywhere — there is no Weasel answer to this
  one. Slot 2 carries no bomb either: it is the cover for
  the climb out of the valley.

PACKAGE
  Colt         : F-16C-50 pair, Senaki, hot ramp. Loadout
                 above.
  Magic        : E-3A AWACS, {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM, over
                 western Georgia. He is also the
                 only receiver we have pointed at
                 those radars.
  Texaco       : KC-135, {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN {_TANKER_TACAN},
                 north of Kutaisi.
  Ferret       : recon team on the ridge above the
                 works, {_FREQ_RECON}.000. Six days in place.
  No escort. No SEAD. The flight covers itself.

INTELLIGENCE
  Ferret has had eyes on the works since the 12th,
  so the site itself is not in question — that is
  a survey, and his coordinate readout is on your
  radio menu in your own cockpit's format.
  The air defence is the part we are guessing at.
  Overhead has been thin for a week and what we
  have is an ELINT cut, so every red ring on your
  map is drawn wide, dashed and marked approximate.
  SAM : Buk-class battery on the plain north of
        the works, assessed 35 km, their best crew.
        S-125 on the site itself, roughly 18 km,
        and self-propelled gun/missile SHORAD plus
        guns inside the wire. Assume all of it is
        cold until something hands it a track.
  EWR : two search radars — one on the plain, one
        in the western foothills. The western one
        looks straight down your egress.
  Air : Mineralnye Vody holds a MiG-29S alert
        section, R-77 shooters, experienced. They
        will launch when the halls go up. You are
        not fragged against them.
  GAP : the picture north of the Kuban bend is
        thin. A Gainful-class emitter came up out
        there ten days ago and we never got a fix,
        so there is no ring on your map for it —
        we would be drawing a guess. It touches
        nothing you have been asked to fly. It
        will absolutely touch you if you chase the
        shipment past the bend.
  Base: Mineralnye Vody is defended in its own
        right — an S-125 on the field. It is 104 km
        from the works and reaches 18. It costs
        your run nothing and a chase everything.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Weapons free on the works, the shipment, and
    any Russian aircraft that comes up against you
    north of the watershed.
  - Both casting halls, or the sortie was a raid
    on a tank farm.
  - 600 m over the floor from the Kodori to the
    Teberda. Cresting a ridge hands them the
    whole plan.
  - Not cleared to pursue over Mineralnye Vody.
  - Not cleared north of the Kuban bend.
  - Bingo fuel: 3000 lb. RTB Senaki over the top.

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY})
  Senaki and Kutaisi both sit under a
  {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery — {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km,
  cyan ring on the map, guns in the Senaki
  overhead. You are 181 km out with nobody behind
  you; if this has gone wrong, the ring is the
  plan. {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a hold abeam
  Senaki, on the map and in the DED. Either
  runway takes you.

NAV
  Bullseye (own side) : {bx:.0f}, {by:.0f} (DCS world m)
  PUSH                : climb-out over the Kolkheti.
  OCHAMCHIRA          : the Abkhaz coastal plain.
  KODORI              : inland, into the valleys.
  KLUKHOR             : the watershed, 3,000 m.
  GONACHKHIR / DOMBAY : down the northern side.
  AZGEK / TEBERDA     : into the Teberda valley.
  NIZHNYAYA / KARACHAY: the masking runs out here.
  IP                  : the Teberda mouth. Pop.
  HALL A / HALL B     : one steerpoint on each
                        casting hall, 220 m apart.
                        Surveyed, not assessed —
                        these two are real.

  Senaki tower  : per kneeboard

NOTES
  Sunrise 07:28 local and you start with it — the
  saddle is crossed in early light, the target in
  full daylight. Broken layer 4500 m. That is six
  hundred metres over the Klukhori, so the pass
  is flown under a ceiling; on the way out you
  climb straight through it. Fly the card.

**Theater:** Caucasus
**Date / time:** 18 October 2026, 07:30 local (sunrise)
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Colt`), Senaki-Kolkhi, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Colt")}
**Difficulty:** ace
**Expected sortie length:** ~55 minutes

## Situation

The chemical works on the Kuban north of Karachayevsk have spent the year
casting solid rocket motors. Every surface-to-air battery this theater has run
into for six months has been fed out of that valley, and the works are in a
valley because that is where somebody decided to build them: there is no
approach to the site above the ridgelines. A Buk battery on the plain to the
north owns that airspace out to roughly 35 kilometres, and this sortie carries
nothing that will argue with it.

**Two casting halls do the work.** Everything else on the site — the tank farm,
the stores, the boiler house — can be rebuilt in a fortnight. The halls cannot.

## Mission

Take `Texaco` before turning north-west, so that the low run starts on full
internal fuel rather than on what is left after the transit. Then fly the
ground:

1. **North-west over the Kolkheti flats and the Abkhaz coastal plain**, low and
   quick. Everything from Ochamchira on is theirs.
2. **Inland up the Kodori** valley system and over the **Klukhori Pass** — three
   thousand metres of rock, flown at six hundred over the floor.
3. **Down the Teberda.** You will be picked up somewhere around Karachayevsk;
   from there it is about two and a half minutes to the pop, so be ready before
   you are detected rather than after.
4. **Pop at `IP`**, where the Teberda opens into the Kuban.
5. **Both casting halls.** Two long sheds in line, north-south, in the middle
   of the yard and west of the tank farm. `Ferret` talks you on. Everything
   else on that site — the tank farm, the stores, the boiler house — is a
   fortnight's work to replace and is not what you came for.
6. **Egress is a climb.** South-west, hard, over the range and feet wet past the
   Abkhaz coast. There is no low way out of that valley once the halls are
   burning, and the Gadfly's ring costs about two and a half minutes on the way
   through it.

The route is checked leg by leg against the elevation raster and the whole of
it — every waypoint and every ramp between two of them — clears the ground. The
kneeboard prints altitudes; the heights quoted in the briefing are above the
valley floor, which is always a smaller number. Fly the card.

## Package

| Callsign | Type     | Base            | Role                                   |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Colt     | F-16C-50 | Senaki-Kolkhi   | Player strike — the casting halls      |
| Magic    | E-3A     | Senaki-Kolkhi   | AWACS, {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM, western Georgia    |
| Texaco   | KC-135   | Kutaisi         | Tanker, {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN {_TANKER_TACAN}          |
| Ferret   | recon    | on the ridge    | Talk-on and laser, {_FREQ_RECON}.000, code {_LASER_CODE} |

No escort and no SEAD element. **And no HARM** — that is the shape of this
sortie rather than an oversight. The belts here cannot be shot; they can only be
avoided, so the terrain is the SEAD and every station that could have carried a
Weasel load carries a bomb instead. Two of those are GBU-38 JDAM for the halls,
which fly to the surveyed coordinates on `HALL A` and `HALL B` and ride no spot
at all. The other two are GBU-12 coded `{_LASER_CODE}`, which is where the pod
comes up and where `Ferret` lases, so his spot and those two seekers need no
arranging.

### `Colt` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Colt", _FITS)}

**Four bombs stay four bombs**, and that is the point of the split rather than
an accident of it. Two casting halls, a shipment that rolls the moment the field
hears the raid, and one magazine to spend across both is the decision this
mission is built on — so slot 2 does not carry a fifth bomb. It carries the
air-to-air fit, because the other half of the sortie is a climb out of the
Teberda inside the Buk's ring with an alert section launching off the halls
going up, and nothing else is coming. Four slots put a second bomber up and the
decision softens.

**They are not four of the same bomb, and the difference is whether the target
moves.** The halls are buildings on a coordinate that has not changed in forty
years, so they get the two GBU-38 and a steerpoint each; you fly to a number
rather than hunt a roof. The column will be eight or ten kilometres up the road
by the time you are done at the works, and nothing satellite-aided can be given
a coordinate for that — so the two GBU-12 on the other station are the
column's, on `Ferret`'s spot. Spending a laser bomb on a hall is legal and
wastes the only weapon you have that can chase anything.

## Objectives

Three, and they are priced separately.

- **The casting halls.** The frag. Two aimpoints, one JDAM each off its own
  surveyed steerpoint, and no second pass worth taking.
- **The shipment.** The night's load is on transporters in the yard and will
  roll the moment the field hears the raid coming, north up the Kuban.
  `Ferret` calls it and lases it on code {_LASER_CODE}, which is your bombs' own
  code, and his coordinate readout — in *your* cockpit's format, off a live
  vehicle — is on the radio menu under **F10 → Other → Ferret**. Catching it is
  worth more than the tank farm is. It also costs bombs the halls may still
  need, which is the decision.
- **Getting out.** The alert section launches when the halls go up, and the
  climb out of that valley is flown inside the Buk's ring.

## Intelligence

`Ferret` has been on that ridge since the 12th, so the works themselves are not
in question — that is a survey rather than an assessment, and it is why `HALL A`
and `HALL B` are steerpoints on the two buildings rather than one assessed point
over the middle of the plot. A chemical plant has been on the 1:100,000 sheet
for forty years; nobody needs an overhead pass to find it, and a satellite-aided
bomb is never better than the coordinate it is handed.

**The air defence is the part we are guessing at.** Overhead has been thin for a
week and what we have is an ELINT cut, so every red ring on the F10 map and on
your HSD is drawn wide, dashed and labelled `(approx.)` — out by kilometres, and
meant to be read that way.

- **SAM (boss):** a Buk-class battery on the plain north of the works, assessed
  at about 35 km against a jet at altitude. That ring is the whole reason for
  this routing: it covers every approach above the ridges, which leaves the
  valleys.
- **Site defence:** an S-125 battery on the works, roughly 18 km, plus
  self-propelled gun/missile SHORAD and guns inside the wire. The SHORAD is
  what the pop-up actually has to survive.
- **EWR:** two search radars — one on the plain feeding the fighter control,
  one in the western foothills that looks straight down the egress. Expect to
  be seen on the way out even though you were not on the way in.
- **Emission discipline:** these crews do not sit on the air. Assume every
  battery is cold until the early-warning chain hands it a track, and assume it
  is quick once it has one. A quiet RWR on the ingress is the plan working, not
  the threat being absent.
- **Air:** a MiG-29S alert section at Mineralnye Vody, R-77 shooters,
  experienced crews. They launch when the halls go up. **They are a threat to
  beat, not a target list** — nothing about this sortie requires them dead.
- **Where the picture is thin:** a Gainful-class emitter came up on the plain
  north of the Kuban bend ten days ago and we never got a fix on it. There is
  no ring on your map because we would be drawing a guess. It reaches nothing
  you have been asked to fly — and it covers the last third of the road the
  shipment is driving up. `Magic` will call it if you go there.
- **Mineralnye Vody field defence:** the same ELINT work puts an S-125 on the
  field. It is 104 km from the works and reaches 18, so it touches no part of
  the run. It is the reason a withdrawing MiG stops being a target.

## ROE

- Weapons free on the works, the shipment, and any Russian aircraft that comes
  up against you north of the watershed.
- **Both** casting halls. One hall and a tank farm is a raid, not a strike.
- Six hundred metres over the valley floor from the Kodori to the Teberda —
  the massif is what hides you, and cresting a ridge to save a turn hands them
  the whole plan.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Mineralnye Vody.**
- **Not cleared north of the Kuban bend**, whatever is driving up it.
- Bingo fuel: 3000 lb. RTB Senaki over the top, feet wet past the coast.

## Fall-back

Senaki is covered by a `{_SANCTUARY}` {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery reaching
{_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, drawn as the cyan ring on the F10 map, with gun sections in
the overhead. Kutaisi is 37 km away and **inside the same envelope**, so a jet
that cannot fly a normal approach has two runways under one battery.

`{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a hold abeam Senaki inside the envelope, on the map and
in the DED, for a damaged jet waiting on the pattern. It matters here because
there is nobody else out there: no escort to trade with, one other jet in the
flight, and 190 km of egress with an alert section behind it. Crossing that
ring is what ends the sortie.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- `PUSH` — climb-out over the Kolkheti lowland
- `OCHAMCHIRA` — the Abkhaz coastal plain. Enemy ground from here on
- `KODORI` — inland, into the valley system
- `KLUKHOR` — the watershed, 3,000 m. The high point of the route
- `GONACHKHIR`, `DOMBAY` — the gorge on the northern side
- `AZGEK`, `TEBERDA` — into the Teberda valley
- `NIZHNYAYA`, `KARACHAY` — down the Teberda. The masking runs out here
- `IP` — the Teberda mouth. Pop here
- `HALL A`, `HALL B` — a steerpoint on each casting hall, 220 m apart.
  Surveyed, not assessed
- `EGRESS_SW` — the climb out of the Kuban
- `RANGE` — over the watershed, high and fast
- `FEET_WET` — past the Abkhaz coast
- `LETDOWN` — let-down for Senaki

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: {_FREQ_AWACS}.000 AM
- Texaco tanker: {_FREQ_TANKER}.000 AM, TACAN {_TANKER_TACAN}
- Ferret: {_FREQ_RECON}.000, laser code {_LASER_CODE}
- Senaki tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` details and the Kutaisi divert are on the kneeboard comms card.

## Weather

October sunrise. Broken layer based 4500 m, 1200 m thick, density 6. It
clears the Klukhori crossing by six hundred metres, and the egress climbs
straight through it — climbing out of trouble on this sortie means going IMC
over five-thousand-metre rock. Light north wind, 4 m/s ground, 9 m/s at
8000 m. 6 °C, visibility 25 km in autumn haze. Sunrise 07:28 local, which is
when you start.

## Difficulty composition

**Ace.** Excellent Buk crew and High site defence, all of it emission-
disciplined and cold until cued; two EWRs; an unlocated Gainful north of the
objective; Excellent MiG-29S alert section scaled off the player count;
**no anti-radiation weapon and no SEAD support**, so the belts can only be
avoided; AWACS and tanker only, both behind the watershed; a 160 km low ingress
over a 3,000 m pass, 190 km of enemy ground each way, and an egress flown inside
the Buk's ring because there is no low way out. One mistake ends the sortie.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Primary success:** both casting halls are down — the works stop producing.
- **Secondary:** the night's shipment never leaves the valley.
- **Failure:** `Colt` goes down with the halls still standing.

        `Ferret` sits on a ridge seven kilometres from the works, so any zone

        better: the field reacts to the attack, which is what a real one does.

        Sized by `_ALERT_SECTION`: a pair for one or two slots, a four-ship
        above that, and no further. The magazine sets the floor — four rails and
        two shots per kill against crews this good makes a pair the whole budget

        sensor sees, so line of sight is a hard filter here rather than a
        preference. It is asked for at three points — the works, the loading
        yard, and a point most of the way up the road the shipment drives —
        which is a different request from asking at one, and it is what turns a

        twenty-one kilometres the column has to cover.

        That visible stretch **is** the window on the second objective, and the
        team is what makes a two-bomb laser pair enough for it: a moving column
        on a road is a hard laser problem for a single jet with nobody to
        buddy-lase, and the honest answer is a controller on the ground rather
        than a bigger magazine. The halls are the other two bombs and need none
        of this — they are JDAM off a surveyed coordinate, which is what frees
        `Ferret` to spend the whole sortie on the one target that moves.

        `FacCallsign.AXEMAN` is left alone deliberately — DCS answers a FAC by
        its index in the game's own callname table, and this team is called
        `Ferret` in the briefing, so `fac_attack_group` is given the callsign
        rather than the group name doing the work. Not `SetInvisibleCommand`

        emission discipline, and without it this mission does not work at all.

        Left to DCS, every battery radiates from mission start. The player's RWR
        would be full before the coast, the whole point of two hundred
        kilometres of valley would be invisible, and a low route that buys
        nothing is just a slow one. With the net, only the two early-warning
        radars are on the air; each battery sits cold until the chain hands it a
        track inside its own reach. So the ingress is quiet because it is
        *working*, the first strobe is the Buk at the IP, and the site defence
        comes up as the player commits — which is the shape the briefing
        promises.

        `go_live_percent` is over 100 everywhere for the usual reason: a DCS site
        needs something like half a minute from cold to a shot, so a battery that
        waits until the target is inside its launch envelope comes up and
        watches. The Buk is the exception in the other direction — 170 % of a
        50 km table range is most of the Kuban bend, and it is meant to be up and
        looking before anything reaches the valley mouth.

        The consequence the briefing depends on: killing an EWR does **not**
        switch the belts off. A battery cut off from the net goes autonomous,
        which with `"ai"` means it searches on its own and radiates continuously
        from then on. That is a trade rather than a win, and on this sortie it is
        a bad one — there is nothing aboard that profits from an emitter being
        findable.

        `Magic` is the only listener, so every emissions call in the mission is
        his ESM watch: a battery behind a ridge from his track, or anything at
        all once he is gone, goes quiet without a word.

        """Paint the plan, and be precise about exactly one enemy thing: the works.

        Every ring here is drawn several kilometres off truth, wider than the
        system reaches, dashed and labelled "(approx.)", which is what the ace
        reveal does and what the Intelligence section claims to have — a week of
        thin overhead and an ELINT cut.

        **The works are the deliberate exception, and they are marked with a
        `waypoint_label` rather than an `objective` ring for that reason.** A
        chemical plant is not intelligence: it has been on the 1:100,000 sheet
        for forty years, it does not move, and a team has been looking at it for
        six days. Drawing it as a twelve-kilometre dashed "vicinity" would model
        an ignorance nobody has, and it would then contradict the two channels
        that cannot be coarsened anyway — `HALL A` and `HALL B` have to be *on*
        the halls or the run-in is a search and the JDAM is a miss, and Ferret's
        readout answers off a live position. This is the same argument
        `PlanOverlay.frontline` makes about a front line, applied to the other
        kind of fixed geography.

        Each hall is labelled where it stands rather than the site carrying one
        label, because the frag is two of the seven buildings on that plot and a
        single marker over the middle of it names none of them. The labels are
        the same two names the steerpoints carry, so the map, the card and the
        DED call the same building the same thing.

        Draw order is a total order in the cartridge's navigation tab and this
        route uses twenty of its twenty-five slots, so the sequence below is a
        budget: the marshal leg first (a damaged jet's hold should not lose to
        an AWACS anchor), then the target, then the recon post, then the things
        that are pleasant to have.

        The shipment's escort SHORAD is a `mobile_threat` — icon and label, no
        ring, nothing returned. It rides on a column that will have driven ten
        kilometres by the time anyone reaches it, and a ring drawn at its start
        point reads as "clear" everywhere it no longer covers.

        Returns the emplaced systems as HSD threat points. The early-warning
        radars are not among them: a search radar has no envelope to fly around,
        and the fifteen pre-planned slots are better spent on things that shoot.
