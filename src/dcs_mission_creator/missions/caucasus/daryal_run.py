"""Caucasus 'Daryal Run' — F-16C ace SEAD strike with low valley ingress.

Player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Vaziani as `Dodge`. The target is a
Russian S-300PS (SA-10) battery emplaced south of Beslan, covering the
North Caucasus from a ridge that denies any high-altitude approach. The
only viable ingress is the Georgian Military Road: north over the Jvari
Pass, then down the Terek through the Daryal Gorge between Mt Kazbek
(5033 m) and the eastern ridge — terrain-masked from the Big Bird radar
until the gorge ends about 16 km short of the battery and the player pops
for the HARM shot. Egress is west across the plain and south up the Ardon
over the Roki Pass; the whole route is checked against the elevation
raster (`_CORRIDOR`, `waypoints.agl_profile`). AWACS `Magic` holds a southern
race-track. No tanker, no escort, no SEAD support.

Composition (difficulty: ace):
  - SA-10 site: 64H6E (Big Bird) SR + 30H6 Flap Lid TR + 54K6 CP +
    4x 5P85C/D launchers. Skill Excellent.
  - 1x SA-15 Tor terminal SHORAD adjacent to the SAM site (Skill Excellent).
  - 2x ZSU-23-4 Shilka AAA at the SAM site (Skill High).
  - 1x 1L13 EWR on a ridge near Mozdok (Skill Excellent), feeding GCI.
  - 2x Russian MiG-29S out of Mozdok, late-activated on an intrusion zone
    just south of Beslan, R-77 / R-27 class, Skill Excellent.
  - USA support: E-3A `Magic` AWACS only, 251.000 AM. No tanker, no
    escort, no SEAD wingman — bandits 2x player, denied support.
  - Weather: autumn dusk, broken layer at 2200 m, light N wind, 12 C,
    30 km visibility (haze + low light).

========================================================
SITUATION
  ELINT has been reading a Big Bird and a Flap Lid south
  of Beslan for three days: a Russian S-300PS battery has
  emplaced on a ridge there and shut down the airspace
  over the North Caucasus to any high-altitude push. The
  bearings cross to within a few kilometres — good enough
  for a target area, not for a pinpoint. Command wants
  those radars off the air tonight, before the layer
  thickens overnight.

  The only viable ingress is the Georgian Military Road.
  North to Pasanauri, over the Jvari Pass, down the Terek
  into the Daryal Gorge between Mt Kazbek and the eastern
  ridge, out at Balta. The massif masks you as far as the
  pass; below Stepantsminda only the gorge does. It narrows
  to roughly 3 km in places — pick your line.

MISSION (Dodge — F-16C-50, Vaziani, hot ramp)
  - Push north above the ridges. The massif is between you
    and the Big Bird the whole way to the pass; no reason
    to be low yet, every reason to be fast.
  - Cross at Jvari, 2400 m, then follow the Terek down. Be
    on the deck by Stepantsminda and stay there.
  - Run the gorge. Pop at the mouth north of Balta, HARM
    the Big Bird, re-attack the Flap Lid and the 54K6 CP.
    Launchers are bonus; the radars are the kill. Two
    HARMs in the flight for two radars — the killer jet is
    what you have if a radar shuts down in time.
  - Egress WEST across the plain, then south up the Ardon
    and over the Roki Pass. Do NOT re-cross Daryal — the
    MiG-29S will be in by then. The climb out of the Ardon
    mouth is the exposed minute of this sortie; take it
    west of Vladikavkaz, not before.
  - RTB Vaziani. Divert: Soganlug.

LOADOUT (shooter and killer)
{self.loadout_brief("Dodge", _FITS)}
  Slot 1 kills the emitters. Slot 2 kills what stops
  emitting.

PACKAGE
  Dodge         : F-16C-50 pair, Vaziani, hot ramp, SEAD
                  frag. Loadout above.
  Magic         : E-3A AWACS, 251.000 AM, race-track over
                  Georgia. No tanker, no escort, nothing
                  else airborne. The pair is the package.

INTELLIGENCE
  No overhead of the site — cloud for two days. What we
  have is the ELINT cut and pattern-of-life. Every ring
  on your map is that cut: drawn wide, dashed, marked
  approximate, and out by some kilometres. Your TARGET
  steerpoint is the same cut, not a survey — expect to
  find the radars, not to fly to them.
  SAM : S-300PS battery. Search radar, tracking radar,
        command post and launchers, reach out to about
        75 km at altitude. Their best crew — assume they
        are alert and assume terminal SHORAD is sited
        with them to close the low block, guns as well.
  Air : Mozdok holds a MiG-29S pair, R-77 shooters,
        experienced. They will launch once you are
        detected south of Beslan.
  EWR : Early-warning radar on a ridge near Mozdok feeds
        the fighters their picture.
  Base: Mozdok is defended in its own right — an S-125
        battery on the field, guns in the overhead. It
        reaches nothing on your route. Do not follow the
        MiGs home to find out.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Weapons free on the SA-10 cluster and any Russian
    aircraft that comes up against you north of
    the border.
  - Keep below 1000 m AGL from Stepantsminda to the gorge
    mouth — Big Bird sees you the moment you crest.
  - Not cleared to pursue over Mozdok.
  - Bingo fuel: 2500 lb. RTB Vaziani via the Ardon and
    Roki, not back through Daryal.

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY})
  Vaziani and Soganlug both sit under a
  {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery — {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km,
  cyan ring on the map, guns in the overhead of Vaziani.
  You are alone out there and you will know before
  anyone else does whether this is still working. If it
  is not, the ring is the plan: cross it and the sortie
  is over. {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a hold abeam Vaziani,
  on the map and in the DED. Either runway takes you.

## Situation

ELINT has been reading a Big Bird and a Flap Lid south of Beslan for three
days: a Russian S-300PS (SA-10) battery has emplaced on a ridge there and
shut the North Caucasus airspace to any high-altitude push. The bearings
cross to within a few kilometres — good enough for a target area, not for a
pinpoint. Command wants those radars off the air tonight, before the cloud
layer thickens overnight.

The only viable ingress is the **Georgian Military Road**: north to
Pasanauri, over the **Jvari Pass** at 2400 m, down the Terek into the
**Daryal Gorge** between Mt Kazbek (5033 m) and the eastern ridge, and out at
Balta. As far as the pass the massif itself does the masking and there is no
reason to be low; below Stepantsminda only the gorge does, and it narrows to
roughly 3 km in places — pick your line.

## Mission

Push north out of Vaziani above the ridges and fast. Cross at Jvari, follow
the Terek down, and be on the deck by Stepantsminda. Run the gorge to its
mouth north of Balta, pop there, HARM the Big Bird, re-attack the Flap Lid
and the 54K6 CP. Egress west across the plain, then south up the Ardon and
over the Roki Pass. Do **not** re-cross Daryal on egress — the MiG-29S CAP
will be airborne by then.

The flight is a shooter and a killer, and the second half of that is the part
worth planning: the radars are the frag, and a crew that hears the launch and
shuts down in time leaves you a target that is no longer a signal.

The climb out of the Ardon mouth is the one deliberately exposed minute of
the sortie: the plain west of Vladikavkaz is still inside the battery's reach
and there is no terrain to use until you are into the Ardon. Take it west of
Vladikavkaz rather than off the target, and take it assuming the radars are
already down — which is what you were sent to do.

## Package

No tanker, no escort, nothing else airborne — denied support is part of the
ace composition, and the flight is the whole package. Carry externals.

### `Dodge` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Dodge", _FITS)}

Shooter and killer, which is what a Weasel pair has always been. Slot 1 kills
the emitters; slot 2 kills what stops emitting, because a battery that goes
dark under an anti-radiation shot is still a battery and a Flap Lid is a
vehicle on a hill rather than a signal.

**Two HARMs for two radars**, and a two-slot flight has no third shot. If the
first pass does not take them, what is left is a submunition run over an S-300
site with a Tor beside it — which is the ace part of this sortie, and the
reason the pop-up geometry at the gorge mouth is worth flying properly the
first time.

## Intelligence

No overhead of the site — cloud for two days. What we have is the ELINT cut
and pattern-of-life, so every position below is approximate — and the map is
drawn to say so. The rings are dashed, wider than the systems reach and
labelled `(approx.)`; so is the pre-planned pair on your HSD. Your `TARGET`
steerpoint is the same cut rather than a survey, so it puts you over the area,
not over the launchers. Find the radars with the HTS.

- **SAM (boss):** the S-300PS battery — search radar, tracking radar, command
  post and launchers — reaching out to roughly 75 km against a fast jet at
  altitude. That ring is on your map, and it is the whole reason for this
  routing: it covers every approach above the ridges, which leaves the gorge.
  Their best crew; assume they are alert.
- **Terminal SHORAD:** a point-defence system is sited with the battery to
  close the low block — assessed, ringed on your map at the same confidence as
  everything else — and assume guns with it.
- **EWR:** early-warning radar on a ridge near Mozdok feeding the fighters.
- **Air:** a MiG-29S pair at Mozdok, R-77 shooters, experienced crews. They
  will launch once you are detected south of Beslan.
- **Mozdok field defence:** the same ELINT work puts an S-125 battery on the
  airfield, with self-propelled guns in the overhead. It reaches 18 km, 78 km
  from your target, so it touches no part of the run — it is the reason a MiG
  that turns for home stops being a target.

## ROE

- Weapons free on the SA-10 cluster and any Russian aircraft that comes up
  against you north of the border.
- Stay below 1000 m AGL from Stepantsminda to the gorge mouth — Big Bird
  sees you the moment you crest.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Mozdok.** A withdrawing MiG is not worth an
  S-125, least of all on the fuel you will have by then.
- Bingo fuel: 2500 lb. RTB Vaziani via the Ardon and Roki, **not** back
  through Daryal.

## Fall-back

Vaziani is covered by a `{_SANCTUARY}` {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery reaching
{_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, drawn as the cyan ring on the F10 map, with gun sections in
the overhead. Soganlug is 8 km away and **inside the same envelope**, so a jet
that cannot fly a normal approach has two runways under one battery.

That matters more on this sortie than on any other. You go 168 km against
the best crew on the map as a pair, with two HARMs between you and no tanker,
no escort and nothing else airborne —
and the one thing that makes "abort and run" a plan rather than a slower loss is
that it ends somewhere. If the run has gone wrong, turn south, take the Ardon and
the Roki as briefed, and cross that ring. `{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a hold abeam
Vaziani inside the envelope, on the map and in the DED, for a damaged jet waiting
on the pattern.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- `PUSH` — climb-out NNW of Vaziani
- `ARAGVI` — Pasanauri, where the route joins the Georgian Military Road
- `JVARI` — the Jvari Pass, 2400 m: the only crossing the road takes
- `KOBI`, `TEREK` — head of the Terek, descending into the gorge
- `KAZBEGI` — Stepantsminda. On the deck from here
- `DARYAL`, `LARS`, `CHMI`, `BALTA` — the gorge, 200–570 m above the floor
- `IP` — the gorge mouth north of Balta. Pop here
- `TARGET` — the ELINT cut, roughly 12 km south of Beslan airfield —
  approximate, not a surveyed fix
- `EGRESS_W` — the plain west of Vladikavkaz
- `ARDON`, `BURON` — up the Ardon on the Transkam
- `ROKI` — over the Roki Pass, into Georgia
- `MTSKHETA` — let-down at the foot of the Georgian Military Road, where the
  route joined it on the way out

The heights above are over the *valley floor*. Your kneeboard prints altitudes,
which is a different and always larger number, and the profile on it clears the
ground on every leg — including the spurs between waypoints, which the Terek
bends round four times between Kobi and Balta. Fly the card, not the difference
between the two.

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: 251.000 AM
- Vaziani tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` details and the Soganlug divert are on the kneeboard comms card.

## Weather

Autumn dusk, broken layer base 2200 m, 800 m thick, density 6.
Light north wind 4 m/s ground, 8 m/s at 8000 m. 12 °C, QNH 760 mmHg.
Visibility 30 km (haze). Sunset ~18:40 local — the valley will be in
shadow by the time you reach the IP.

## Difficulty composition

**Ace.** Excellent SA-10 + SA-15 + EWR, Excellent MiG-29S CAP, bandits
2x player flight, R-77 class missiles, AWACS-only support (no tanker, no
escort, no Weasel wingman), dusk with broken layer, a 180 km gorge-only
viable ingress, west-only viable egress. One mistake ends the sortie.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Success:** the battery's search and tracking radars are both off the air
  for good — the North Caucasus is open again.
- **Failure:** `Dodge` goes down with the battery still tracking.

        `keep_clear` on our side is the whole red order of battle, which at 168
        and 245 km is never in question — it is passed anyway so a future change
        to the AO fails loudly instead of quietly switching the mission off.
        On theirs it is the objective plus every flown point of the route,
        including the egress up the Ardon, which is the leg that comes back
        nearest Russian territory.

        looking like an eccentric routing choice and starts looking like the
