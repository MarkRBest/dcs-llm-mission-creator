"""Caucasus 'Kodori Strike' — F-16C mixed package strike on a Russian FOB.

Player flies a USAF F-16C-50 out of Kutaisi as `Dodge`, lead element of a
strike package hitting a Russian forward operating base on the coastal plain
at the Kodori delta, east-southeast of Sukhumi-Babushara. `Weasel` (F-16C SEAD)
rolls back an SA-6 site on the rising ground inland, with LOS to the FOB.
`Eagle` (F-15C high cover)
holds an overlay-placed CAP station between Kutaisi and Gudauta, ready for
the Russian Su-27 CAP launched on intrusion. `Magic` AWACS and `Texaco`
tanker sit on overlay-placed race-tracks opposite the threat axis.

All ground placements (FOB road snap, SA-6 site inland, SA-13 point defence,
55G6 EWR) and the player's ingress corridor come from the `map_overlay`
tactical-scene helpers — not hand-tuned cardinal offsets.

Composition (difficulty: trained):
  - 2x Russian Su-27, Skill.High, R-27/R-77 class, launched on intrusion trigger.
  - Russian FOB: 2x T-72B, 4x BTR-80, 2x KAMAZ supply, 1x ZSU-23-4 Shilka,
    snapped onto the coast road at the Kodori delta.
  - SA-6 site: 1x Kub 1S91 radar + 2x Kub 2P25 launchers on prominent
    terrain with LOS to the FOB (Skill.High).
  - 2x SA-13 (Strela-10M3) dug in around the FOB, covering the approach
    the package flies in on.
  - 1x 55G6 EWR on prominent ground in the Russian rear, feeding GCI.
  - USA support: E-3A `Magic` + KC-135 `Texaco` on overlay-placed race-tracks
    behind Kutaisi. F-15C `Eagle` 2-ship on a CAP station forward toward Gudauta.
  - Weather: late-spring clear morning, light W wind, 22 C.

========================================================
SITUATION
  Satellite imagery over three passes this week has
  watched a Russian forward operating base grow on the
  coast road at the Kodori delta, ESE of
  Sukhumi-Babushara: armour, supply trucks, dug-in guns.
  That road is the only supply artery into Abkhazia,
  which is why the base is on it. Yesterday's pass
  caught freshly graded revetments on the rising ground
  inland, and an ELINT cut the same night put an SA-6
  fire-control radar in that area — assess the site is
  now live. SHORAD is reported dug in around the base
  itself. Early-warning radar in the Russian rear hands
  the picture to the Su-27s at Gudauta, who launch
  against anything crossing the Inguri.

MISSION (Dodge — F-16C-50, Kutaisi)
  Lead the strike on the FOB. Weasel rolls back the SA-6
  ahead of you. Eagle holds a CAP station between Kutaisi
  and Gudauta and handles the Su-27 intercept. Push along
  the terrain-masked ingress corridor, tank pre-strike if
  needed, work the target box, RTB Kutaisi.

LOADOUT (the flight splits the target)
{self.loadout_brief("Dodge", _FITS)}
  Slot 1's submunitions are for the platoon in the open;
  slot 2's laser bombs are for the tanks and the Shilka.
  There is no controller on this target: slot 2 lases its
  own, pod and bombs both on {_LASER_CODE}, which is where
  they come up. Nothing to arrange.

PACKAGE
  Dodge        : F-16C-50 pair, Kutaisi, hot ramp, strike.
                 Loadout above.
  Weasel 1-2   : F-16C-50 SEAD, Kutaisi, hunting SA-6.
  Eagle 1-2    : F-15C high cover, overlay CAP station.
  Magic        : E-3A AWACS, 251.000 AM, overlay track.
  Texaco       : KC-135, 252.000 AM, TACAN 10Y, overlay track.

INTELLIGENCE
  Air : Gudauta keeps a Su-27 pair ready, current
        missiles, experienced crews. Early-warning radar
        in the rear will see you and vector them.
  SAM : ELINT places an SA-6 fire-control radar on the
        rising ground about 10 km inland of the base,
        looking straight down onto it — that is Weasel's
        problem. Imagery also shows tracked IR launchers
        dug in around the base. Stay above 4500 m AGL in
        the target box until Weasel calls the SA-6 cold.
  AAA : Guns inside the FOB perimeter, seen on every
        imagery pass this week.
  Base: Gudauta is defended in its own right — an S-125
        battery on the field and guns in the overhead.
        Do not follow the Su-27s home.

ROE / FRAGS
  - Cleared to engage Russian aircraft entering the AO.
  - Hold ordnance until Weasel reports the SA-6 down or
    the FOB is the only viable target.
  - Not cleared to pursue over Gudauta.
  - Bingo fuel: 3000 lb. RTB Kutaisi (divert: Senaki).

FALL-BACK ({_SANCTUARY})
  Kutaisi and Senaki both sit under a
  {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery — {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km,
  cyan ring on the map, guns in the overhead of Kutaisi.
  If you are hit, out of ordnance or out of fuel, that
  ring is the answer: get inside it and the fight is
  over. {_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL is a hold abeam Kutaisi,
  on the map and in the DED. Either runway works.

NAV
  Bullseye (own side): {bx:.0f}, {by:.0f} (DCS world m)
  AO center         : coast road at the Kodori delta,
                      ~8 km ESE Sukhumi-Babushara.
  PUSH waypoint     : 18 km NW of Kutaisi.
  Ingress           : terrain-masked corridor, routed to keep
                      ridgelines between you and the reported
                      radars and the Gudauta approach.
  Cartridge         : the Gainful, the IR launchers and the
                      Gudauta belt are loaded as pre-planned
                      threats — select PRE on the HSD for the
                      rings. Estimates, same as the map, no
                      better than the cut.

**Theater:** Caucasus
**Date / time:** 20 May 2026, 10:00 local
**Player aircraft:** F-16C-50 (`Dodge`), Kutaisi, hot ramp
**Players:** {self.slot_summary("Dodge")}
**Difficulty:** trained — experienced Su-27 pair with GCI, one radar SAM plus
SHORAD dug in over the target, dedicated SEAD element, AWACS and tanker
**Expected sortie length:** ~75 minutes

## Situation

Satellite imagery over three passes this week has watched a Russian forward
operating base grow on the coastal plain at the Kodori delta, east-southeast of
Sukhumi-Babushara: armour, supply trucks, dug-in guns. It sits on the coast
road, which is the only supply artery into Abkhazia and the reason the base is
where it is. Yesterday's pass caught freshly graded revetments on the rising
ground inland, and an ELINT cut the same night put an SA-6 fire-control radar in
that area — the site is assessed live. SHORAD is reported dug in around the base
itself. Early-warning radar in the Russian rear hands the picture to the Su-27s
at Gudauta, who launch against any USAF package crossing the Inguri.

## Mission

Lead the strike on the FOB as `Dodge` flight. `Weasel` rolls back the SA-6
ahead of the strike, `Eagle` holds a CAP station between Kutaisi and Gudauta
and handles the Russian Su-27 intercept. Push along the terrain-masked
ingress corridor, tank pre-strike if needed, work the target box, RTB
Kutaisi.

The base is a scattered platoon with armour in it, and the flight carries two
answers to that rather than one compromise — see the loadout table below.

## Package

| Callsign  | Type     | Base    | Role                   |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Dodge     | F-16C-50 | Kutaisi | Player strike flight   |
| Weasel 1-2| F-16C-50 | Kutaisi | SEAD on SA-6           |
| Eagle 1-2 | F-15C    | Kutaisi | High cover CAP         |
| Magic     | E-3A     | Kutaisi | AWACS, 251.000 AM      |
| Texaco    | KC-135   | Kutaisi | Tanker, 252.000 AM 10Y |

### `Dodge` loadout

{self.loadout_table("Dodge", _FITS)}

Nine vehicles scattered over a clearing, two of them main battle tanks and one
a Shilka, is not one target — so the flight does not carry one weapon. Slot 1
has four CBU-105: wind-corrected submunitions, which is what kills a dispersed
platoon in a single pass from above the IR launchers you have been told to stay
over. Slot 2 has four GBU-12 on TERs and the pod to find the armour and the
gun with, because a submunition pattern is the wrong answer to a T-72 in a
revetment. Four air-to-air missiles a jet, and they are for getting home:
`Eagle` owns the Su-27 fight.

There is no ground controller on this target. Slot 2 self-designates: the pod
and the GBU-12s are both on **{_LASER_CODE}**, which is the code they come up
on, so there is nothing to set and nobody to raise before the first pass.

75-minute sortie is well past F-16C internal endurance, so the tanker is
mandatory — top off pre-strike on the way in, again post-strike if needed.

Terrain, not a template, decides where the FOB, the SAM site and your
corridor sit — they are re-derived every time the mission is generated, so
brief off this sheet rather than off a previous sortie.

## Intelligence

Everything below is imagery and ELINT from the last three days. The SAM and
SHORAD positions are assessed to within a few kilometres, and the map rings
are drawn as estimates for that reason. The base itself is the one thing that
has been watched long enough to be pinned, and the frame below is yesterday's
pass over it.

{self.recon_figure_md()}

- **Air:** Gudauta holds a Su-27 pair ready — current missiles, experienced
  crews — launched against any package that crosses the Inguri and vectored by
  early-warning radar in the Russian rear.
- **SAM:** the ELINT cut puts an SA-6 fire-control radar on the rising ground
  about 10 km inland of the base, with a clean look down onto it. Kill the radar
  and the launchers up there are blind. Imagery also shows tracked IR launchers
  dug in around the base — stay above 4500 m AGL in the target box until
  `Weasel` calls the SA-6 cold.
- **AAA:** guns inside the FOB perimeter, on every imagery pass this week.
- **EWR:** early-warning radar on commanding ground in the Russian rear,
  feeding the Gudauta GCI.
- **Gudauta field defence:** the same ELINT work that found the Gainful puts an
  S-125 battery on the airfield itself, with self-propelled guns in the
  overhead. It reaches 18 km and covers nothing you need — but it is the reason
  a Su-27 that turns for home stops being a target.

## ROE

- Cleared to engage any Russian aircraft entering the AO.
- Hold ordnance until `Weasel` reports SA-6 down or the FOB is the only
  viable target.
- **Not cleared to pursue over Gudauta.** A withdrawing Su-27 is not worth an
  S-125.
- Bingo fuel: 3000 lb. RTB Kutaisi (divert: Senaki-Kolkhi).

## Fall-back

Kutaisi is covered by a `{_SANCTUARY}` {_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.name} battery reaching
{_SANCTUARY_BATTERY.radius_m / 1000:.0f} km, drawn as the cyan ring on the F10 map, with gun sections in
the overhead. Senaki-Kolkhi is 37 km away and sits
**inside the same envelope**, so the divert is a runway with cover over it
rather than an unmarked strip: take whichever is closer to where you break off.

That ring is where the sortie stops being dangerous. If you are hit, out of
ordnance or below bingo, run for it rather than turning back into a fight you
have already lost. `{_SANCTUARY} MARSHAL` is a hold abeam Kutaisi inside the
envelope, on the map and in the DED, for sorting out a damaged jet or waiting
on the pattern.

## Navigation

- Bullseye (own side): `{bx:.0f}, {by:.0f}` (DCS world m)
- AO center: ~8 km ESE of Sukhumi-Babushara, on the coast road across the
  Kodori delta. The supply road is the reason the base is there.
- PUSH waypoint: 18 km NW of Kutaisi.
- Ingress: terrain-masked corridor, routed to keep ridgelines between you and
  the reported radar positions and the Gudauta approach.
- TANK orbit: standoff track behind Kutaisi.
- Your data cartridge carries the Gainful, the IR launchers and the Gudauta
  field battery as pre-planned threats — select PRE on the HSD (they show on
  the HAD too) for the rings. They are the same estimates as the map, and no
  better than the cut they came from.

## Frequencies

- Magic AWACS: 251.000 AM
- Texaco tanker: 252.000 AM, TACAN 10Y
- Kutaisi tower: per kneeboard
- `{_SANCTUARY}` details and the divert are on the kneeboard comms card.

## Weather

Late-spring clear morning, light W wind, 22 °C. QNH 760 mmHg. Visibility
80 km. Thin scattered layer at 3000 m, 400 m thick.

## Win / loss conditions

- **Success:** the FOB is wrecked — armour, trucks and stores burning in the
  valley.
- **Failure:** `Weasel` is lost with the FOB still standing; without SEAD the
  strike is not worth flying.

        the Gainful inland, because it is an ELINT cut and not imagery at all,
        and the IR launchers dug in around the base, which the earlier passes
        found but which are a fifth of a pixel here. Both are already an
        estimated ring on the map and a point in the cartridge; a bracket here
        would be a third, better-looking guess at the same site.

        The registration bias is 200 m rather than the 1.2 km default, for the
        reason `PlanOverlay.detections` documents: this frame is a coastline, a
        road net and villages, so the product is registered against them. At the
        default the bracket would sit a kilometre off the road the base is on, in
        a picture that draws the road.
