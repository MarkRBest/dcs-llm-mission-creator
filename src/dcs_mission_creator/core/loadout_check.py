"""Check a loadout against what the game itself flies (project-owned).

pydcs answers one question about a store: does this station accept it. That is
a real check and `core/loadout.arm_unit` gets it for free — a wrong attribute
name is an `AttributeError` at build time rather than a silently empty rail.
It is also a low bar. **Legal is not realistic**: pydcs will happily put a
Sidewinder on an F-16C's station 3 and an AMRAAM on its station 2, which is the
pair every mission in this project had the wrong way round until somebody read
ED's own payload tables and found that the wingtips carry the AMRAAM.

Those tables are the authority, and they are on disk:

    <DCS>/CoreMods/aircraft/<module>/UnitPayloads/<type>.lua
    <DCS>/MissionEditor/data/scripts/UnitPayloads/<type>.lua

Every loadout ED ships for an airframe, as (CLSID, station) pairs. So "which
stations does the game actually hang this store on" is a lookup rather than a
memory, and a store on a station no shipped payload uses is worth a second look
— not an error, because a mission may have a reason, but the kind of thing that
should be a decision rather than an accident.

    from dcs_mission_creator.core import loadout_check

    for note in loadout_check.check(planes.F_16C_50, fit.stores):
        print(note)

With no `DCS_INSTALL_DIR` there is nothing to read and every check comes back
empty, exactly as `load_task_default_loadout` does — the tables ship with the
game, not with this project, and a check that guessed without them would be
worse than no check. `core/audit.py` says so out loud rather than reporting a
clean bill of health it did not earn.
