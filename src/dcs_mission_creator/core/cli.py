"""The `python -m dcs_mission_creator.missions.<slug>` entry point.

Every mission module stayed runnable on its own, which meant every one carried
the same twenty-five lines of argparse. Worse, each spelled its own output
default as a literal `out/<slug>` beside a `name = "<slug>"` class attribute,
so the two could drift apart.

Missions now call `run_cli(TheBuilder)` and the slug comes from the class.
