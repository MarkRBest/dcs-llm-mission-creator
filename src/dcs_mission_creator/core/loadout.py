"""Who in the flight carries what (project-owned helper).

Every mission here armed the player flight from **one** `stores` list, which
was correct while a mission was a single jet and is a wasted flight the moment
it is two. A two-ship is not two copies of the same aeroplane: it is a lead and
a wingman who between them carry the whole frag, and the F-16C's six weapon
stations are far too few for one jet to hold both halves of any real tasking.
The arithmetic is blunt — stations 4 and 6 are the bags, 5 is the ECM pod, 10
and 11 are the pods, so what is left is 1/2/3/7/8/9, and the two ends of that
(1/9, 2/8) only take a missile. **Three stations decide the sortie**, and a
mission that spends 3/7 on HARM has no bomb and one that spends them on bombs
has no HARM.

So the flight splits the frag instead:

    _FITS = (
        loadout.Loadout(
            role="HARM/HTS",
            carries="two AGM-88C, HTS and the pod, four AIM-120C",
            stores=((1, _AMRAAM), ..., (10, _HTS), (11, _TGP)),
        ),
        loadout.Loadout(
            role="CBU-105/TGP",
            carries="four CBU-105 on BRU-57, the pod, two AIM-120C, two AIM-9X",
            stores=(...),
        ),
    )

`assign` hands one fit to each slot by **cycling the list in order**, which is
the whole scaling rule: two slots are the pair the mission was written for, four
are two elements each carrying the same split (so an element that loses its
partner is still half a package rather than a jet that cannot do the job), and a
mission that wants a third capability at four slots declares a third fit. The
cycle is deterministic and slot 1 is always the first fit, so the briefing can
name who is carrying what without holding the built mission.

Two things follow that are worth stating because they were bugs first:

- **A DCS group's units carry their own pylons.** `FlyingGroup.load_pylon`
  writes the same store to every unit in the group, so arming a flight through
  it can only ever produce a uniform one; the split is written per unit
  (`Unit.load_pylon`), and `arm_unit` clears the stations first for the same
  reason `mission_kit.arm` does — the task default has already run and would
  survive on any station the list skips.
- **The magazine is per fit, not per jet.** `core/mission_builder`'s force
  balance rule ("a mission may not task more kills than the flight is carrying
  weapons for") counts air-to-air missiles, and with a split flight that count
  is a property of the *assignment*: `air_to_air_shots` reads it off the stores
  that were actually loaded, so a mission sizing its opposition off the player
  count cannot drift away from what the jets are carrying.

The briefing renderers are here rather than in the mission for the usual
reason: `readme()`, the in-game briefing text and the kneeboard remark are three
views of one table, and typing the split three times is how a briefing ends up
promising a HARM to a jet that has bombs on 3 and 7.
