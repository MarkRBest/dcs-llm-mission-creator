"""The four documents, checked against the code they describe.

Nothing in CI read a document until this file existed, and every one of them had
drifted: two mission catalogues frozen at six entries in a repo of eight, a
`--difficulty` flag `generate` has never had, a `python3.12` grep recipe against
a 3.14 venv, `core/kneeboard.py` for a package. None of that is catchable by
reading — it is only catchable by asking the code.

The checks are deliberately about *facts a doc asserts*, never about prose. A
document may say whatever it likes; it may not name a file that is not there, a
flag that does not parse, or a count that a directory listing contradicts. Where
a fact has one true home the test points at that home rather than at a literal —
the mission catalogue is checked against `missions/`, the slot range against
`MissionBuilder`.

Fast by construction: no DCS install, no map overlay, no mission is built.
