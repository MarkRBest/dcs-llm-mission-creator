"""Smoke test: every discovered mission builds a readable `.miz`.

Deliberately asserts nothing about mission *content* — only that generation
succeeds and produces a well-formed package. What goes inside a mission is a
design decision that changes often; freezing it in a test would make every
balance tweak look like a regression.

Generation reads the per-theater overlay, a multi-GB build artefact that CI
does not have, so the whole module skips when it is missing.

    checks that two builds agree, not what they agree on.

    Compared entry by entry rather than as whole files, because the archive is
    not byte-identical and never has been: `Mission.save` writes `mission`,
    `options`, `warehouses` and the two `l10n/DEFAULT` files with
    `zipfile.writestr`, which stamps each local header with the current time. A
    whole-file comparison therefore passed only while both builds landed inside
    the same two-second DOS-timestamp bucket — true for two warm builds at 0.08 s
    each, and false whenever the first build paid a cold cost (opening the
    overlay, rendering a recon still) and pushed the pair across a boundary. That
    made a genuine property look flaky and a flaky assertion look like evidence
    of byte-identity. Contents are the property the project actually holds, and
