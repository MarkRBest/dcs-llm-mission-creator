"""Unit tests for `MissionBuilder` base behavior.

No overlay and no DCS install are involved: `FakeBuilder` overrides `build_miz`
so nothing real is assembled, and the tests exercise the base-class plumbing —
player validation, difficulty resolution, and `generate`'s filesystem contract.
`test_build_miz_*` covers the template method itself with a stub assembler.
