"""Unit tests for `core/mission_kit.py`'s player-flight split.

A `Mission(Caucasus())` is cheap and needs neither a DCS install nor the map
overlay, so these run in the default (fast) selection. What is asserted is the
mechanism — how many groups, how big, what they are called and that they are
recorded as one flight — never a mission's composition.
