# Project notes for Claude

A pydcs-based DCS mission generator.

## Where a fact lives

Five homes, and a paragraph goes where its **question** is asked. Partitioning
by topic does not work: the laser code is a design decision, a pydcs fact and a
project convention at once, so all three documents could honestly claim it and
all three wrote it out.

| Home | Answers | Test |
|---|---|---|
| [README.md](README.md) | *What is this project, and what ships with it?* | Is the reader a human who has just arrived? |
| [PYDCS_REFERENCE.md](.claude/skills/dcs-mission/PYDCS_REFERENCE.md) | *What does this pydcs call do?* | Would it still be true if this repo had no missions in it? |
| [SKILL.md](.claude/skills/dcs-mission/SKILL.md) | *What should this mission contain?* | Would changing it change what the mission contains? |
| **This file** | *How do I call this repo's code correctly?* | Does it give me a name, an argument, or an ordering constraint in `src/`? |
| the module docstring | *Why is this code the way it is?* | Is it evidence for a decision already made? |

The last one is where most of the mass belongs, and three rules keep it there:

- **One home per fact, one exception.** A document may point at another; it may
  not restate it. The exception is a *value you have to type* — repeat the
  value, never the argument. So SKILL.md says "the code is 1688" and points here
  for why `laser.set_code` refuses anything else.
- **Pointers run outward from this file, never in a cycle.** This file may point
  at either skill document; those two may point back only for the *name* of a
  helper, never for a rule they own.
- **A measurement may appear twice only as evidence for two different rules.**

And the line that decides the hard cases:

> If deleting a sentence would make an agent write **wrong code**, it belongs
> here. If deleting it would only make the agent **unable to argue with the
> design**, it belongs in the module docstring.
>
> A number is *contract* if it is an argument or a limit — 98 kneeboard columns,
> fifteen threat points, twenty-five GEO vertices, `MIN_PLAYERS`. A number is
> *evidence* if it is a measurement — 170 m, 21 minutes, 19.6 t, 9.0 m/s.

Every "(project-owned)" section below is therefore short on purpose: what to
call, what the arguments mean, who calls it, and one pointer to the module whose
docstring carries the argument for it. **Read that docstring before changing the
module** — it is where the reasoning went, not a summary of this file.

## The base class already does these — never call them from a mission

Six of the defect classes this project has shipped were "a mission called
something `MissionBuilder.build_miz` already calls", so the list is here rather
than spread across the sections that describe each one:

| Step | Module |
|---|---|
| time and weather applied | class attributes, see *Package layout* |
| the F10 `PlanOverlay` constructed and handed to `_assemble` | `core/map_draw.py` |
| enemy coalition concealed | `core/visibility.py` |
| briefed rings into the cartridge, plan into the steerpoint tab | `core/dtc.py` |
| the briefing panels and sortie name written | — |
| the loadout-split kneeboard remark | `core/loadout.py` |
| the AI package held until a player is airborne | `core/join_up.py` |
| take-off / landing altitudes snapped to the field | `core/waypoints.py` |
| the 108 kt departure gate corrected | `core/waypoints.py` |
| datalink track numbers and team members assigned | `core/datalink.py` |
| every AI flight's radio tuned to the frequency it was briefed on | `core/radio.py` |
| the cartridge file, the kneeboard cards and the recon still written into the `.miz` | `core/dtc.py`, `core/kneeboard`, `core/recon` |

**The base owning a step does not mean a mission cannot change it.**
`_finish_briefing` is a normal method: a mission that wants a group left visible
on purpose overrides it and calls `super()` for the parts it still wants. What
the base guarantees is that nothing is *forgotten*.

# The contract

## Package layout

Mission scripts go in the appropriate terrain package beneath
[src/dcs_mission_creator/missions/](src/dcs_mission_creator/missions/), for
example `caucasus/<scenario_slug>.py`, with one concrete subclass of `MissionBuilder`
([core/mission_builder.py](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/mission_builder.py))
per module.

**What a mission declares.** Data first, because most of it is:

```python
class CoastalCover(MissionBuilder):
    name = "coastal_cover"                 # filesystem slug, matches the filename
    title = "Coastal Cover"                # display name
    difficulty = Difficulty.TRAINED        # the enum, not a string
    terrain = Caucasus                     # the pydcs class, not an instance
    blue_task = "Escort Hawg 1-2 onto ..."  # the two coalition task panels
    red_task = "Push the column through ..."
    start_time = datetime(2026, 5, 15, 10, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    weather = Weather(name="Spring scattered", ...)
```

`difficulty` drives both the F10 reveal and the enemy ROE. `start_time` is
map-local: pydcs serialises the hour and minute verbatim and DCS reads the field
as map-local, so `tzinfo` is inert — write the local time you want. **None of
these has a default** — a mission that forgets one fails rather than quietly
shipping mid-morning clear. Each is read through a method (`start_time_for(m)`,
`weather_for(m)`, `blue_task_text()`, `red_task_text()`) so a mission that needs
to *compute* one overrides that instead.

**What a mission implements** — three abstract methods and nothing else:

- `_assemble(self, m: Mission, plan: PlanOverlay) -> Assembled` — build the
  whole mission into `m`. `plan` is the F10 overlay, constructed by the base so
  a mission whose route geometry reads `plan.estimate` does not have to think
  about ordering. Return `Assembled(overlay, briefed_threats)`: the overlay the
  positions came from, and whatever `_draw_plan` produced.
- `_in_game_briefing(self) -> str` — the in-game description panel, plain text.
- `readme(self) -> str` — the README.md content: the mission *briefing* in
  markdown (situation, mission, package, threats, ROE, navigation, frequencies,
  win/loss conditions, re-generation command), not metadata. Both briefing views
  read class state so they cannot drift apart.

Use `self.players` for client-slot counts — `MIN_PLAYERS` to `MAX_PLAYERS`, 2–6,
validated by the base. Build the player flight with `mission_kit.player_flight`,
never with a raw `group_size=self.players`, and the flight splits its loadout
across the slots (see *Loadouts*).

**What the base owns** is the table above, plus `_permit_crash_recovery`, which
forces `permitCrash` on (the ME's "PERMIT CRASH RCVR", `m.forced_options`) so a
player who crashes lands back on slot selection instead of in the debriefing.
Nothing else is forced. `generate(output_dir)` seeds the RNG, then writes
`<name>.miz` and `README.md`.

Three of the base's steps run *after* the save: a data cartridge, the kneeboard
cards and the recon still are files **inside** the `.miz`, and `Mission.save`
writes a fixed set of zip entries with no hook for another one. The kneeboard is
last for a second reason — its route card prints the take-off and landing
altitudes the snap has just corrected.

Each module also exposes a one-line `main()` so the script stays runnable via
`python -m`. The argparse lives in
[core/cli.py](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/cli.py) and takes the slug and title
off the class, so the two cannot drift:

```python
def main() -> None:
    run_cli(CoastalCover)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

[`__main__.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/__main__.py) auto-discovers every public
submodule of `missions/` and exposes it as a `generate <name>` subcommand (plus
`list`, `audit`, `survey`, `route`, `map-overlay`). The slug is optional:
`generate` with no name builds **every** mission into its own package-matched folder,
logging past any that raise and exiting 1 if any failed. Default output is
`$DCS_MISSIONS_FOLDER/IAGeneratedMissions/<map>/<package>/<mission>/`; the CLI errors out if that
is unset and no `--output-dir` is given. `out/` and `*.miz` are gitignored.

## Script structure: small named functions

`_assemble` is the orchestrator, not the implementation. Each block of the
mission gets its own method whose name says what the block produces and whose
docstring states the design intent in one line. Pattern (see
[coastal_cover.py](src/dcs_mission_creator/missions/caucasus/coastal_cover.py)):

```python
def _assemble(self, m: Mission, plan: PlanOverlay) -> Assembled:
    """Assemble the mission by calling each step in package order."""
    scene = self._setup_airports(m)
    usa, russia = m.country("USA"), m.country("Russia")

    convoy, _sa13, _ewr = self._spawn_red_ground(m, russia, scene)
    self._spawn_awacs(m, usa, scene)
    hog = self._spawn_strike(m, usa, scene, target_unit=convoy.units[4])
    self._spawn_cap(m, usa, scene)
    self._spawn_red_intercept(m, russia, scene)
    self._spawn_player(m, usa, scene)

    self._add_end_triggers(m, convoy=convoy, hog=hog)
    briefed_threats = self._draw_plan(m, scene, plan=plan, ...)

    # The base conceals the enemy, loads the cartridge, writes the briefing
    # panels, then snaps waypoints and saves.
    return Assembled(scene.overlay.overlay, briefed_threats)
```

Rules:

- Each helper does **one thing** (one flight, one ground cluster, one trigger
  group, one briefing block). Past ~25 lines, split it further (e.g.
  `_spawn_red_ground` → `_spawn_red_convoy` / `_spawn_red_shorad` /
  `_spawn_red_ewr`).
- The docstring is the design intent ("F-15C 2-ship Eagle on a race-track
  between Batumi and the AO"), not a restatement of the code.
- Bundle resolved airports + AO center into a `_Scene` dataclass so spawn
  helpers take `scene` instead of five positional airport args. Type the fields
  as `Airport` (`dcs.terrain.terrain.Airport`) so ty can verify downstream calls
  like `player.land_at(scene.batumi)`.
- Return the groups the orchestrator still needs (e.g. `convoy`, `hog` for
  end-of-mission triggers); name throwaways with a leading underscore.
- **A helper whose body has no per-mission payload should not exist.** The test
  is not "is this a block" but "would a second mission write this differently" —
  if not, it is mechanism and belongs in `core/`.

## Mission scaffolding helpers (project-owned)

Four small modules hold what every mission used to carry its own copy of. None
of them holds policy: force composition, timings and text stay in the mission.

- [`core/mission_kit.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/mission_kit.py) —
  `offset(origin, *, east_m, north_m)` (DCS `x` is north and `y` is east; this
  is why call sites never say so), `mark_clients(group)`, `arm(...)` (see the
  loadout rule below), `race_track(p1, p2)` for the orbit arguments
  `awacs_flight` / `refuel_flight` want, `unit_of_type(group, type)`,
  `set_skill(group, skill)`, and the three walks every core module needs —
  `flying_groups(m)`, `flying_groups_by_side(m)`, `is_client(group)` and
  `player_groups(m)`. Import these rather than redefining them.

  Use `unit_of_type` — never `group.units[0]` — when an objective means "kill
  the radar". pydcs's own `VehicleTemplate.Russia.sa10_site` puts a paratrooper
  at index 1, so an index-based win condition silently becomes "kill one
  infantryman"; `unit_of_type` raises instead.

  **The player flight is `mission_kit.player_flight`, not
  `flight_group_from_airport`.** A DCS plane group holds **four** airframes and
  pydcs does not enforce that, it *clamps* —
  `group_size = min(group_size, aircraft_type.group_size_max)`, no warning — so
  six coop slots in one group silently ship four. `player_flight` splits the
  slots (`section_sizes`: 5 is `(3, 2)`, 6 is `(4, 2)`, never a four-ship
  trailed by a lone jet), builds each section from the same field, arms each
  **slot** from the flight's own fit table (`loadouts=`, see *Loadouts*), marks
  the slots and records the groups as **one flight**. The mission then gives each
  section the same route — which is why every `_spawn_player` here ends in a
  `_route_<callsign>` helper: the corridor is a search against the terrain, and
  two sections searching separately would fly two plans under one briefing.

  Four things read that record rather than counting groups: `core/datalink.py`
  teams the sections together (one net, not two), `core/dtc.py`'s "two player
  Viper flights" guard asks *what the groups are*, `MissionBuilder.slot_summary`
  writes the README's `**Players:**` line off `mission_kit.section_names` (which
  `readme()` can reach without a `Mission`), and `mission_kit.slot_names(flight,
  slots)` is the `"<group> Pilot #<n>"` string DCS puts on the slot-selection
  screen — a five- or six-slot flight restarts its pilot numbers at the second
  section, so "slot 5" and "Pilot #1" are both true of the same jet and only one
  is clickable.

  A trigger gated on "the player" needs every section:
  `mission_kit.sections_of(m, group)` hands back the section-mates of any flight
  (and just that flight for one built any other way). AND the `GroupDead`s
  (a loss call must not fire with jets still up); OR `PartOfGroupInZone` with
  `condition.Or()`, since pydcs's condition list is ANDed and listing both would
  hold the call until both had crossed.

- [`core/weather.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/weather.py) — the weather as
  one frozen record instead of fourteen assignments. A mission declares it as
  the `weather` class attribute and the base applies it; the record is public so
  `weather_for(m)` can build a different one.
- [`core/triggers.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/triggers.py) — the
  voice-plus-text radio call. **Use these instead of hand-rolling the rule**:
  they use `text` for both the on-screen `MessageTo*` and the TTS render by
  default. Pass `voice_text` only when speech needs a pronunciation spelling
  that should not appear in the subtitle.

  ```python
  from dcs_mission_creator.core import triggers as mission_triggers

  mission_triggers.message_to_all(m, comment="Strike successful", voice=self._voice,
                                  conditions=(condition.GroupDead(convoy.id),),
                                  text="Magic: the column is wrecked...")
  mission_triggers.message_to_coalition(m, ...)   # one coalition only
  mission_triggers.checkin(m, at_seconds=180, ...)  # support check-in on the clock
  mission_triggers.intro(m, ...)                    # TriggerStart mission picture
  ```
- [`core/cli.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/cli.py) — `run_cli(TheBuilder)`,
  the whole body of a mission's `main()`.

## Mission Lua lives in `.lua` files

Never embed mission-script Lua as a Python string literal. Every `DoScript`
payload is a real file under
[core/lua/](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/lua/) (e.g. `iads.lua`), loaded via
that package's loader:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import lua

script = lua.render("iads.lua", SITES=rows, SIDE="coalition.side.BLUE",
                    COOLDOWN="20.0")
rule.add_action(lua.InlineDoScript(script))
```

Attach it with `lua.InlineDoScript`, **never** pydcs's `action.DoScript` —
which parks the Lua in the l10n dictionary and produces a trigger that dies at
mission start (PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §7.1 has the mechanism and the exact error).
`InlineDoScript` writes the source into the action's own `text` field, the way
stock ED missions do.

`lua.render(name, **subs)` replaces `__KEY__` placeholders with already-formatted
Lua source and raises if a substitution names a placeholder the file lacks or if
any `__PLACEHOLDER__` survives (a leftover would be a Lua syntax error at mission
start). It does no quoting itself — build string literals with `lua.quote(text)`,
which also renders `None` as `nil` (an empty string would still pass a Lua truth
test, so an absent radio call or laser code would print as a blank one).
`lua.source(name)` returns the raw text. New `.lua` files are picked up
automatically; the `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` entry ships them in the wheel.

## Briefings, factions and statics — where the rules are

How a briefing reads, how a narrative names a side and how far apart to space
building aimpoints are **design policy** and live in the `dcs-mission` skill.
What is convention rather than design, and therefore stays:

- **Faction names in prose, coalition names in code.** `readme()`,
  `_in_game_briefing()` and every trigger message say USA, USAF, Russia,
  Russian, Syrian. `set_blue()` / `Coalition.Blue` /
  `set_description_bluetask_text` are API names and keep theirs; "blue side" is
  fine in a code comment.
- **`_draw_plan` must not draw more precision than the prose claims.** The
  reveal policy and the briefing are one statement.
- **A building objective is `m.static_group(...)`, and `condition.UnitDead`
  resolves it.** The editor's own `unitsLister` enumerates `Mission.unit_by_id`,
  which holds statics alongside vehicles, so "destroy the building" is a
  one-line trigger on `group.units[0].id`. `GroupDead` is the wrong tool — a
  static group is not a group in the scripting sense. `conceal_country` covers
  statics, which matters more here than for vehicles: an unhidden compound shows
  every building as an icon and hands the player the whole aimpoint choice
  before he starts engines.
- **A building is flown to exactly, one steerpoint per building, and the call is
  `waypoints.add_target_waypoint(flight, static_group, ...)`.** It takes the
  built `StaticGroup` rather than a `Point`, so a `PlanOverlay` estimate cannot
  reach it, and it reads the position off the unit rather than off the plot-plan
  constant the layout may have been nudged away from. The reveal policy in
  `core/map_draw.py` coarsens what an enemy *system* is assessed to **reach**,
  and a building reaches nothing; with a satellite-aided weapon an assessed
  aimpoint is not a thinner picture but a miss. Label it on the F10 map with
  `plan.waypoint_label` at the same position and under the same name — never
  `plan.objective`, which loosens with difficulty — and never one point over the
  compound, because two aimpoints at one steerpoint is one aimpoint.
  `core/audit.py`'s `target waypoint` check enforces the other end: every static
  a trigger condition names has to have a client steerpoint within
  `audit.TARGET_WAYPOINT_M`.

# Helpers, in the order you call them

## Air-defense builder (project-owned)

[`air_defense`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/air_defense.py) builds a **whole
SAM site** — search radar + track/fire-control radar + command post +
launchers, wired into one `VehicleGroup` — from a single call. It fills only the
sites pydcs's `dcs.templates.VehicleTemplate` lacks; for `sa6/sa10/sa11/sa15` +
`patriot/hawk` call `VehicleTemplate` directly.

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import air_defense as ad

sa3 = ad.build_sa3_site(m, russia, ridge, heading=270, launchers=4,
                        skill=Skill.High)
# rough terrain: pass the overlay + terrain to snap units off canopy/water
sa5 = ad.build_sa5_site(m, russia, hill, heading=180,
                        overlay=scene.overlay.overlay, terrain=self._terrain)
```

Builders: `build_sa2/sa3/sa5/sa8/sa13/sa15/sa19_site`,
`build_nasams/irist/roland/rapier/hq7_site`
`(m, country, position, heading, *, launchers=None, prefix="", skill=Skill.Average,
overlay=None, terrain=None) -> VehicleGroup` — one shared `SiteBuilder`
signature; `launchers=None` means "whatever this system normally fields". Each
site is a `_SiteSpec` table entry (leader, components, launcher type) assembled
by one engine, so **adding a system is a table entry, not a new function**.
Pass `overlay` *and* `terrain` together or neither — one alone used to skip
snapping in silence and now warns. Absolute world `Point` in, raw pydcs
`Country` in (no faction abstraction), a built group out. `set_skill` lives in
`core/mission_kit.py` and takes any group. Positions come from the
`core/placement.py` helpers (`sam_site_on_ridge`, etc.). Design rules (what
threat where, per difficulty) are in the `dcs-mission` skill; the unit-type
catalog and the `VehicleTemplate` split in PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §5.

**Sites are laid out dispersed**, with the search radar and command post pushed
off the position and every placement wobbled, so a site has a real gap in its fan
and the axis a stick of bombs is laid down matters.

`disperse_site(group, *, radius_m, overlay=None, terrain=None)` applies the same
treatment to a group this module did not build — in practice a pydcs
`VehicleTemplate` site, which parks its launchers within a bomb's effect of the
radar. It **inflates** the template's own layout: each unit keeps its bearing,
distances are scaled so the outermost sits at `radius_m`, then jittered — so
**unit order is untouched**, keeping `units[0]` the radar for every
`unit_of_type` objective. Call it *after* any extra units the mission adds to
the group, or those stay where the mission put them. Every mission that uses a
pydcs template does (SA-6 → 300 m, SA-11 → 400 m, SA-10 → 500 m).

*Why those distances, and the two bounds that keep dispersion from making the
briefed ring wrong, are in `core/air_defense.py`'s docstring.*

## Somewhere to fall back to (project-owned)

[`sanctuary`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/sanctuary.py) gives each side a
**defended** place to run to, so that disengaging is a decision and pursuit is
priced. **Every mission carries one on each side**, with a `## Fall-back`
briefing section, a "not cleared to pursue over `<enemy field>`" ROE line, and
the enemy field's belt in the HSD cartridge and the kneeboard threat block.

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import sanctuary as sanc

home = sanc.build_sanctuary(
    m, usa, scene.batumi, callsign="BULLDOG",
    facing=scene.ao_center,               # the threat axis
    battery=sanc.HAWK,                    # 45 km, off the jet's own table
    keep_clear=[scene.ao_center, *red_sites],
    alternates=[scene.kobuleti],          # warns if not actually covered
    overlay=scene.overlay.overlay, terrain=self._terrain,
)
red = sanc.build_sanctuary(
    m, russia, scene.sukhumi, callsign="Sukhumi field",
    facing=scene.ao_center, battery=sanc.SA_3,
    enemy=True, label="SA-3 Sukhumi",     # <=20 chars: the kneeboard column
    keep_clear=[scene.ao_center, *friendly_stations],
    skill=Skill.Average, overlay=..., terrain=...,
)
```

Then in `_draw_plan`, **first**:

```python
home.draw(plan)                    # returns [] — our battery is not a threat
return hsd + red.draw(plan)        # returns the pre-planned threat point
```

plus `sanc.remark_all(m, home, red)` and one
`mission_triggers.checkin(..., text=sanc.checkin_text(home, controller="Magic"))`.
The check-in is not decoration: a cyan ring reads as decoration and nobody opens
the F10 map again after push — same argument as `core/jtac`'s `push_at_s`.

**Both sides get one, and what differs is the reveal, not the geometry:**

| | friendly | enemy |
|---|---|---|
| F10 | `PlanOverlay.umbrella` — precise at **every** difficulty | `PlanOverlay.threat` — estimated, per the reveal policy |
| cartridge | the marshal leg / a divert field, as steerpoints | a pre-planned threat point via `dtc.briefed` |
| kneeboard | a REMARKS line naming the cover | the route card's threat block, like any belt |

A battery the player's own side emplaced is not intelligence, so the umbrella is
drawn precisely at every difficulty, and cyan rather than red because every red
circle means "do not go here" and this one means the opposite.

**`keep_clear` is the invariant, and `build_sanctuary` raises on it.** An area
SAM is a mission-warping object, and an umbrella that touches the AO deletes the
mission rather than providing a refuge. The reach comes off the F-16C's own
`THREAT_PTS` table in `core/dtc.py`, the same rows the cartridge is written
from, so nobody re-types a range. **The two lists are not the same list, and the
helper cannot tell them apart for you.** Out of *our* umbrella goes whatever the
enemy needs left standing — the AO, the belts, the EWRs — and nothing else: a
CAP station 45 km up the axis and a PUSH point 25 km north of the field are
*supposed* to be inside it. Out of *theirs* goes every friendly station and the
whole ingress corridor. When the check refuses a field, the answer is usually
that the field was wrong; the three ways it refuses, what each is telling you,
and the cases where the obvious field was the wrong one are in
`core/sanctuary.py`'s docstring.

`Battery` is a table entry: name, the `dtc.ThreatSystem` its reach comes from,
how to build it, and the self-cueing SHORAD that goes on the field (Avenger for
NATO, 2S6 for Russian — it comes with the area system because the two are not
independent). `HAWK` / `PATRIOT` / `NASAMS` blue, `SA_2` / `SA_3` / `SA_10` red.
The two pydcs `VehicleTemplate` sites hard-code `mission.country("USA")` and
ignore the country handed to them, so those **refuse** any other country rather
than filing a Turkish battery under the USA.

**`divert=True` is the one distinction between a primary field and a divert.**
The primary field is already the flight's take-off and landing waypoint, so a
mark on it restates the route; what it adds is the **marshal leg**, a race-track
abeam the field inside the envelope. A divert has no waypoint near it, so its
**position** is the whole point, and nobody diverts in order to orbit. Two
consequences that were bugs first:

- **The marshal leg has to fit inside its own envelope.** It halves until the
  far end is inside `_MARSHAL_FIT` of the envelope, measured **from the
  battery**, which is offset up the threat axis.
- **A ring takes no navigation steerpoint.** `PlanOverlay.umbrella` records its
  own `"umbrella"` mark kind, which `dtc.plan_steerpoints` does not turn into a
  point: a ring is an *area* and its centre is a battery 4.5 km off the runway.

Design rule as everywhere in `core/`: absolute world `Point` / pydcs `Airport`
and `Country` in, built groups out. Which field, which system and what the
briefing says are the mission's decisions; every mission states its callsign and
battery as module constants (`_SANCTUARY`, `_SANCTUARY_BATTERY`) and
interpolates them into both briefing views, so the prose cannot drift from the
reach that was actually emplaced.

The red half needs no scripting — DCS AI already RTBs on bingo
(`tasking.apply_ai_difficulty` sets it). On a mission with an IADS net its
battery belongs **in** the net (`idlib_gauntlet` adds Bassel as a `Site`, slowest
reactions and shortest `react_range_m`), or the airfield belt is the one battery
that stays up under a HARM.

## Front-line helper (project-owned)

[`frontline`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/frontline.py) is the geometry of a
front: the reason a mission's target cannot be attacked from an arbitrary
bearing. Without one, the player arcs wide of every belt and comes in from the
quarter nobody covered.

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.frontline import plan_frontline

front = plan_frontline(
    defends=scene.route_mid,          # what the line stands in front of
    facing=scene.hatay.position,      # the side the threat comes from
    standoff_m=26_000.0, span_m=90_000.0, bow_m=12_000.0,
    sectors_per_side=2, seam_width_m=30_000.0,
    overlay=scene.overlay.overlay, terrain=self._terrain,   # both or neither
)
front.trace       # the drawn polyline, flank to flank, seam included
front.shoulders   # the two tips — where the area SAMs go
front.sectors     # the dug-in positions between them, seam excluded
front.seam        # the crossing the briefing points at
front.facing_deg  # heading a site on the line wants
```

Geometry only — no groups, no tasks, exactly like `core/routing.py`. Force
composition (an S-125 battery per shoulder, armour + guns + MANPADS per sector)
is mission policy. `span_m` is the detour a flanker pays and `bow_m` sweeps the
wings toward `facing` so the flanks are the long way in as well as the far way
round; `seam_width_m` is the frontage with no position on it. Feed the shoulder
envelopes into `_threat_rings` so the drawn plan, the cartridge and the AI routes
are one claim, and draw the trace with `PlanOverlay.frontline` — the trace is
public knowledge, so it is the one red thing drawn precisely at **every**
difficulty. Design rules (how to price each way in, depth coverage, the seam)
live in the `dcs-mission` skill; `TacticalScene.place_frontline` is the different
question (a FLOT meandering between two known anchors).

## AI-tasking helpers (project-owned)

[`tasking`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/tasking.py) holds the AI verbs that
carry real project policy — not 1:1 pydcs passthroughs (carrier/nav beacons stay
raw pydcs; see PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §6.5):

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import tasking

tasking.apply_ai_difficulty(cap, self._difficulty)   # ROE/react/radar/ECM/bingo
tasking.apply_threat_reaction(pontiac)               # friendly: bypass/CM/ECM
tasking.fac_attack_group(jtac, convoy, frequency=133) # JTAC lases target group
tasking.scramble_on_trigger(m, reserve,               # cold-ramp alert-5
                            condition.PartOfCoalitionInZone("blue", zone.id))
```

- `apply_ai_difficulty(group, difficulty)` — maps the mission's recruit→ace
  label onto `OptROE`/`OptReactOnThreat`/`OptRadarUsing`/`OptECMUsing`/
  `OptRTBOnBingoFuel`/`OptRestrictAfterburner`. A behaviour dial distinct from
  raw `Skill`. Takes `Difficulty` or a str label; reuses the `map_draw.py` enum.
  It is the **enemy** dial — don't reach for it on the friendly package.
- `apply_threat_reaction(flight, *, reaction=ByPassAndEscape, …)` — the friendly
  counterpart: `OptReactOnThreat` (fly around a threat zone rather than through
  it), `OptChaffFlareUsing` inside a SAM WEZ, `OptECMUsing` on lock, RTB on
  bingo. Every AI flight in a blue package gets it **except AWACS and Tanker**,
  because `ByPassAndEscape` on an orbiting tanker pulls it off station; escalate
  to `AllowAbortMission` for one that should turn around rather than press a live
  belt. Pair it with `core/routing.py` — the option only covers the site the
  planner did not know about. `restrict_afterburner` is documented under *Every
  speed is km/h true airspeed*.
- `fac_attack_group(fac_group, target_group, *, designation=Laser, frequency=…)`
  — turns a ground JTAC or airborne FAC(A) into a controller that lases
  `target_group`; derives both the id **and** name pydcs needs (mismatch =
  silent no-op).
- `scramble_on_trigger(m, group, *conditions)` — sets the flight uncontrolled
  with a queued `StartCommand` and pushes it on the condition(s); generalizes
  pydcs `FlyingGroup.delay_start` (time-only) to any condition.

## Threat-aware routing helper (project-owned)

[`routing`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/routing.py) plans AI routes *around*
the SAM belts. pydcs plans them straight through: `Mission.strike_flight` joins
base → IP → target → base on one line, with an attack waypoint pydcs hard-codes
to `alt = 0`. Build the route by hand instead:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.routing import ThreatRing, avoid_threats, standoff_point

belts = (ThreatRing(sa2_pos, 40_000.0, "SA-2 belt"),      # same radii `_draw_plan` paints
         ThreatRing(sa6_pos, 25_000.0, "SA-6 belt"),
         ThreatRing(sa8_pos, 10_000.0, "SA-8 belt"))
ip = standoff_point(target, toward=scene.hatay.position, threats=belts)
for pt in avoid_threats(scene.hatay.position, ip, belts)[1:]:
    flight.add_waypoint(pt, altitude=6400, speed=800)
```

- `avoid_threats(start, target, threats, *, clearance_m=…)` — bends each leg
  around the ring it cuts deepest until nothing enters a ring. Rings covering
  `start` or `target` are **skipped** (you cannot detour out of the envelope your
  target sits in) — that is why the IP comes from `standoff_point` first, so the
  unavoidable exposure is a short run-in, not the whole ingress.
- `standoff_point(target, *, toward, threats, …)` — IP / hold point outside every
  ring, searched outward from the target and swinging round the flank when the
  direct side is covered.
- `ThreatRing(position, radius_m, label)` — build these **once** per mission (an
  `_threat_rings` step) and feed both `_draw_plan` and the routing calls, so the
  ring the player is briefed on is the ring the friendly package flies around.
  Radar-only sites (EWR) are not rings — nothing needs to avoid them.

Geometry only: no groups, tasks or waypoints, and the rings use the **true**
position rather than the drawn estimate (see *Map-drawing helper*). The
behaviour half — `tasking.apply_threat_reaction` — is a separate call and every
routed flight wants both. Design rules (how much exposure a difficulty accepts)
live in the `dcs-mission` skill.

## Waypoint-altitude helper (project-owned)

[`waypoints`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/waypoints.py) puts on the terrain the
waypoints that belong there. pydcs carries no height map: `land_at()` and the
take-off point of an airfield start are hard-coded to `alt = 0` (buried under any
field above sea level), and a steerpoint dropped on a ground target keeps the
route's ingress altitude. Those altitudes are the steerpoint elevations the jet's
CCRP/CCIP, HUD and DED read, so both get corrected from the overlay's elevation
raster:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import waypoints

ov = scene.overlay.overlay                     # the MapOverlay behind TacticalScene
waypoints.add_ground_waypoint(player, scene.route_mid, overlay=ov,
                              speed=750, name="CONVOY AO")
waypoints.snap_base_waypoints(m, ov)           # every flight's take-off + landing
waypoints.ground_elevation_m(ov, point)        # raw lookup, 0.0 outside the overlay
waypoints.clear_terrain(route, altitudes, overlay=ov)   # the whole route, legs included
```

`snap_base_waypoints` walks every flying group, so it cannot miss a flight added
later. **Missions no longer call it** — `MissionBuilder.build_miz` runs it after
`_assemble` returns and before the save, which is why `_assemble` returns the
overlay. `add_ground_waypoint` is for **client** routes only: an AI flight flies
its route altitudes, so a deck-level turning point flies it into the terrain.
Missions with no other overlay need (`daryal_run`, `abkhaz_sweep`) carry a
`load_scene(<theater>)` handle in their `_Scene` for this. Design rules (which
waypoints, where the run-in altitude goes) live in the `dcs-mission` skill; the
pydcs waypoint API and the gotcha in PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §4.3.

`clear_terrain(route, altitudes, *, overlay, clearance_m=CLEARANCE_M,
sample_m=50.0)` is the third case: an **en-route** altitude a mission typed by
hand. It only ever raises, so a mission's own numbers are a floor, and it checks
the straight legs as well as the points. `Leg` + `agl_profile(legs, overlay, *,
clearance_m, ground_floor_m=None)` is the form a low route actually wants — a
`(name, position, agl_m)` table in degrees, converted against the raster.
`ground_floor_m=0.0` is for a route with water under it, where the raster holds
depth below datum. `sample_m` defaults to the raster's 50 m cell because
sampling coarser than the data steps over a one-cell spur. It deliberately does
**not** cover the leg into or out of an `add_ground_waypoint` steerpoint: that
point carries the target's *elevation* rather than a commanded altitude, so the
ramp to it reads as terrain penetration in every mission here and is not one.
*Why an AMSL altitude typed by hand is the dangerous one is in that module's
docstring.*

`set_departure_speeds(m)` fixes the same class of defect one field over.
`add_runway_waypoint` hard-codes 108 kt at 300 m AGL and takes no speed
parameter, which is below a loaded jet's stall speed (the arithmetic is in
PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §4.3); the AI's answer to an unflyable command is max alpha
and full throttle. The helper writes the flight's **own next en-route speed**
there, so no per-airframe table has to be invented; it only ever raises the
value, so it is idempotent and a mission that sets its own departure speed keeps
it. The **approach** runway waypoint carries the same 108 kt and is left alone on
purpose: by then the jet is light and that is roughly its real approach speed.
**Missions never call it** — `build_miz` does, right after
`snap_base_waypoints`.

## Every speed is km/h true airspeed

**Write speeds in km/h and check them against the airframe.** Every pydcs speed
argument — `add_waypoint`, `OrbitAction`, `awacs_flight`, `refuel_flight`,
`patrol_flight`, `intercept_flight`, `flight_group_inflight`, and
`waypoints.add_ground_waypoint` on top of them — is **km/h true airspeed**,
stored as `speed / 3.6` m/s. None says so in its signature and none validates
the number, so a knots-shaped value is accepted in silence and commands roughly
**54 %** of the intended speed. The failure it produces is the friendly package
flying its whole sortie in afterburner: at a knots-shaped speed a fighter is far
below best-climb and deep on the back side of the drag curve, and the AI holds
the commanded altitude on the throttle.

**The ratio is the check, not the number.** `FlyingType.max_speed` is km/h too
(per-airframe table in PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §4.2). On a **supersonic fighter** a
cruise or orbit speed lands at **0.30–0.40 of `max_speed`**; under ~0.2 is the
unit error, over ~0.40 is afterburner — the two bounds `core/audit` checks. The
band does *not* transfer to subsonic types: their `max_speed` is barely above
their cruise, so an E-3A at 0.86 and an A-10C at 0.72 are correct. The same
km/h is a different fraction of a different jet's ceiling, so weigh the airframe
*and* the loadout: a bombed-up jet sits at the bottom of the band, a clean CAP
at the top. Correct per airframe, **never by a blanket ×1.852** — 400 kt is
740 km/h, which is *above* the A-10C's never-exceed. Where a bare number would
be ambiguous, name the unit like `idlib_gauntlet`'s `_FAC_SPEED_KPH` does.

Four places the check has to reach, each of which shipped a real defect:

- **The departure gate**, pydcs's hard-coded 200 km/h (0.10 of `max_speed`) on
  every flight — corrected by `waypoints.set_departure_speeds`, above. A speed
  under ~0.2 of `max_speed` is the signal, not the noise: an audit that filters
  the sub-300 km/h waypoints out walks straight past the worst bug in the file.
- **`Mission.flight_group_inflight`**, which has nothing downstream to catch it:
  `set_departure_speeds` only rewrites runway waypoints, so an airborne spawn
  given metres per second holds that number for its whole first leg and the build
  says nothing.
- **The last leg as well as the cruise.** The *approach* gate is left at 108 kt
  on purpose, but the leg **into** it is flown at that speed, so a route whose
  last en-route point is 40 NM out spends twenty minutes of the sortie there.
  Put a let-down waypoint about 19 NM from the field (`daryal_run`'s `MTSKHETA`,
  `ansariyah_works`' `DESCENT`).
- **Weight, which no waypoint reaches.** The DCS AI's own take-off and climb-out
  routine is high deck angle and both burners lit until it is established. So
  `apply_threat_reaction` takes `restrict_afterburner` (default `False`, the DCS
  default): set it on a **heavy strike flight** where burner buys nothing and the
  fuel matters, never on a CAP or interceptor that needs it in a merge, and only
  on a flight whose route already bends around the live rings.

`core/audit.py` checks every commanded speed against the airframe's own
`max_speed`, and its docstring carries the measured table of what the repo
actually shipped. Re-run `dcs-mission-creator audit` after touching any route;
the pydcs-side gotcha, including the `strike_flight` / `sead_flight` helpers that
pick `max_speed * 0.8` (Mach 1.4 for a Viper) for themselves, is in
PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §4.2.

## The package waits for the player (project-owned)

[`join_up`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/join_up.py) fixes the timing defect
every mission here shipped with: **the AI launched without the player.** pydcs
and the ME both start an AI flight at `TriggerStart`, and a cold or warm Viper is
eight to twelve minutes of startup and taxi while an A-10 pair is rolling in
ninety seconds. Nothing in the route fixes that — the AI is flying its plan
correctly, it just started without him.

So every friendly flight that departs from a field is set uncontrolled with a
queued `StartCommand`, and one `TriggerOnce` per flight pushes it the moment
**any player slot is above 50 m AGL**. **Missions never call it** — `build_miz`
does, right after `_assemble` returns, for the same reason as
`snap_base_waypoints`: a flight added later cannot miss it.

Four exclusions, and each is a way the sweep would otherwise break a mission
rather than fix it:

- **Anything whose job is a station** (`ON_STATION_TASKS` — AWACS, Refueling,
  CAP): all three have to be there before the package needs them. The task name
  is the mission author's own declaration of which kind of flight it is
  (`patrol_flight` writes `CAP`, a strike or an escort does not), so it is what
  the split reads. This is the one exclusion stated as a name rather than
  derived.
- **A flight that spawns airborne** (`Mission.flight_group` with `airport=None`)
  — an uncontrolled aircraft in the air does not start up, it falls.
- **A flight the mission already holds.** `tasking.scramble_on_trigger` and
  pydcs's own `intercept_flight` both set `uncontrolled` themselves, so a second
  push would race the release the mission wrote.
- **The enemy**, derived rather than hard-coded: the sweep holds the coalition
  the client slots are on. Red launching on its own clock is the mission's threat
  model.

`launch_immediately(group)` is the per-flight opt-out for what the task name
cannot express. Nothing uses it yet. **Any** player slot rather than all of them
(waiting on the slowest pilot stalls a six-slot coop), with a
`TimeAfter(FALLBACK_S)` OR'd in so a server with nobody slotted launches after
fifteen minutes. *Which three flights are actually held, and the measured
before/after on their briefings, are in `core/join_up.py`'s docstring.*

## Integrated air-defence helper (project-owned)

[`iads`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/iads.py) gives radar sites the two
behaviours DCS does not model — a net that decides when to radiate, and a crew
that reacts to being shot at. It ships walder's
[Skynet-IADS](https://github.com/walder/Skynet-IADS) inside the `.miz` and drives
it, while keeping this project's own model of what a crew knows about an
anti-radiation launch:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.iads import Listener, Site, arm_iads

arm_iads(
    m,
    [Site(sa6, "SA-6", go_live_percent=150, probability=0.9,
          delay_s=(14, 40), shutdown_s=(280, 400)),
     Site(sa2, "SA-2", go_live_percent=130, probability=0.7),
     Site(ewr, "EWR", role="ewr"),          # a unit, not a group — see below
     Site(sa10, "SA-10", act_as_ew=True, point_defence=sa15)],
    listeners=[Listener(magic, "Magic")],   # who can hear a radar change state
    voice=self._voice,                      # calls are spoken as well as printed
    down_call="Magic: {label} has ceased emissions, site is dark.",
    up_call="Magic: {label} is radiating again, expect it hot.",
    debug=False,                            # Skynet's own live/dark output
    trace=False,                            # our own decisions; follows `debug`
)
```

It adds **three** mission-start triggers the first time it is called, in order:
`core/lua/mist_shim.lua`, `core/lua/vendor/skynet-iads.lua` (both as
`a_do_script_file` resources — 117 KB is not inline material), then the generated
setup as an `InlineDoScript`. A second call reuses the loaded framework.

**Two switches, one per half of the design.** `debug` is Skynet's, and it prints
**on the player's screen** as well as to `dcs.log`. `trace` is ours: which sites
could see a launch, what each roll was against, how long each stayed dark, where
a battery drove, and why a site was left out of a reaction — `dcs.log` only, one
line per decision under an `IADS/<net name>` prefix (`grep 'IADS/' dcs.log`), and
drawn from the same rolls whether or not anyone reads it. `trace` follows `debug`
unless set, so a shipped mission wants `trace=True, debug=False`.

Per site the mission states `go_live_percent` — a fraction of the system's *own*
reach, so an SA-8 and an S-200 are configured identically without anyone looking
up either envelope; go **over 100** or a battery comes up and watches rather than
shoots, since a DCS site needs ~30 s from cold. Plus `engagement_zone`
(`"kill"` / `"search"`), `act_as_ew`, `autonomous`, `point_defence`.

The SEAD difficulty statement is the per-site dials, and each has a band that is
not guessable:

| dial | what it is | band |
|---|---|---|
| `probability` | does this crew act on a launch it saw | |
| `delay_s` | recognition lag — nobody in the site gets a launch warning | **tens of seconds**, the order of a HARM's time of flight; single digits mean no HARM ever connects |
| `shutdown_s` | how long it stays dark | **minutes**, not Skynet's 180 s cap past impact; repeat fire extends it |
| `react_range_m` | how far down the net the launch travels | |
| `scoot_after_s` | time on the air that compromises the position | |
| `emission_limit_s` / `emission_pause_s` | how long a look is, and the quiet between | defaults off the group's DCS `Skill` (`_EMISSION_BY_SKILL`) |

Both time bands are drawn triangularly, so the middle of the band is the common
case, and a suppressed site is released to *cold*, not hot.

Four rules that decide whether the feature works at all:

- **`role="ewr"` registers a unit, `role="sam"` a group** — different classes
  inside the framework. An `"ewr"` group must hold exactly one unit (the helper
  raises rather than guess which one is the radar).
- **Something must radiate.** An all-cued net has nothing to hand tracks down;
  the helper warns when no site is `role="ewr"` or `act_as_ew`.
- **Only radar-guided sites.** SA-13 and MANPADS have nothing to shut down, and
  listing a mixed convoy would make the whole column hold fire on every HARM
  shot.
- **`listeners` gates every radio call**, live: alive, in range, in line of
  sight. Declare none and the net is silent, which is the honest default;
  `arm_iads` warns when calls are configured with no listener, because the
  wording is set in Python and the silence happens in Lua. Calls are queued
  `announce_spacing_s` apart so a shot that darkens a belt gets one per site.

Two behaviours briefings depend on. **Killing the early-warning chain does not
switch the belts off** — a battery with no live parent goes *autonomous*, and
with `autonomous="ai"` (the default, and doctrine) it searches on its own,
radiating continuously. That is a real trade, not a win; `autonomous="dark"`
shuts it down instead, which done to a whole net makes two HARMs end the SAM
threat. And **a look never refuses an engagement** — the emission clock is held
while there are missiles in flight or a target inside the launchers' envelope,
and an EWR or `act_as_ew` site is exempt unless a band is given explicitly.

`alert_window_s` (120 s, the order of a HARM's time of flight) is the answer to
the shot at a *dark* site: an observed launch leaves the net on notice, and a
site coming up inside that window is told about the shot at its `net_relay`
share of `probability`, timed from when it came up. Only an observed launch arms
it, so masking a shot from the whole net still reaches nobody, and `0.0` switches
it off. `jockey_m=None` lets a table (`_MOBILE_TYPES`) decide who relocates;
**infantry** and **optically guided launchers** are refused outright, and every
hop is drawn from the site's **start** point so repeat fire cannot walk a battery
out of the ring `PlanOverlay` drew.

*The reaction model, the bands, the jockey distances, which calls are silent and
why, and the vendored Skynet build with its two seam tests are all in
`core/iads.py`'s docstring and its `_EMISSION_BY_SKILL` / `_JOCKEY_*` comments.
Design rules (what reveal, what difficulty) are in the `dcs-mission` skill; the
pydcs `DoScript` mechanics in PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §7.*

## JTAC coordinate-readout helper (project-owned)

[`jtac`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/jtac.py) fixes the one thing about a DCS
JTAC no mission-editor setting reaches: the coordinate system. The stock 9-line
and target call both go through `MGRS:make(point, 4)` in the game's own
`Scripts/Speech/NATO.lua`, so **every** airframe is read a 4-digit military grid
— right for an A-10's CDU, useless in an F-16 whose DED takes degrees and decimal
minutes and cannot enter a grid at all. `arm_jtac_coords` adds a radio request
that answers in the format of the airframe that asked:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.jtac import CoordTarget, arm_jtac_coords

arm_jtac_coords(
    m,
    [CoordTarget(convoy, label="Hammer 1-1", what="the resupply column",
                 laser_code=1688)],
    menu_title="Hammer 1-1",          # name it after the controller's callsign
)
```

The format comes from the requesting *player group's* aircraft type via
`COCKPIT_COORD_FORMAT` (only the grid cockpits are listed — A-10A/C/C II,
AH-64D, OH-58D; everything else falls through to `default_format=DDM`), so one
JTAC reads a grid to a Hog and degrees-and-minutes to a Viper in the same
mission, and a player who swaps slots gets the new cockpit's format. Override per
mission with `formats={planes.FA_18C_hornet.id: CoordFormat.MGRS}`. The position
is read off a live unit on each request, so it is current for a column that is
still driving; the reply is **text only**, since the numbers are computed in the
mission while `VoiceSynth` renders its audio ahead of time. This does not replace
`tasking.fac_attack_group`, which is what makes the controller acquire, lase and
talk — arm both.

**Place a ground controller with
[`placement.observation_post`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/placement.py)**, not
with a concealment helper: a DCS JTAC lases what its *own* sensor sees, and
`place_ambush_on_route` / `infantry_treeline` carry no line-of-sight constraint.
Pass **several points spread along whatever is being watched** — one point is
satisfied by any hollow that can see one point. The visible stretch is then the
mission's strike window, so it is worth measuring and worth saying out loud on
the radio.

**Pass `push_at_s`** (mission seconds, just after the call that announces the
target — not at check-in, since the readout answers off a live unit and will
happily read out coordinates for something the controller has not yet said he
can see) unless there is a reason not to. Without it the feature is invisible:
DCS keeps reading its own grid and the player has no reason to look in F10 →
Other. Say where the entry is in the briefing too, and say that the stock
nine-line is a grid — otherwise the two calls look like a bug.

## Laser codes (project-owned)

[`laser`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/laser.py) owns the one number a briefing
must not get wrong. A mission that hangs a laser-guided weapon makes two claims —
the controller's spot is on code N, and the bombs will track it — and DCS has
already decided both for almost the whole fleet: **an AI JTAC lases 1688 and
nothing else**, and **most cockpits come up on 1688 too**, because the F-16C,
F/A-18C and A-10C carry no laser-code property at all. Which task fields exist
and which four airframes *do* expose one is PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §6.1.

The rule: **one code per mission, and unless every laser weapon in it belongs to
an airframe whose code the mission can write, that code is `DEFAULT_CODE`.**

```python
_LASER_CODE = laser.DEFAULT_CODE      # the mission's one code
laser.set_code(section, _LASER_CODE)  # after `arm`, per flight with a laser weapon
laser.laser_guided_stores(flight)     # which loaded stores ride a spot
```

`set_code` writes the properties where they exist and **refuses** any other code
where they do not; `core/jtac.py` refuses a `CoordTarget.laser_code` that is not
`laser.AI_JTAC_CODE` for the same reason. From the cockpit a bomb that tracks
nothing is indistinguishable from one that failed to guide, and the player's own
recourse — retune the pod — is the one thing that cannot help.

**Then the briefing says the number for the bombs, not only for the spot.**
"`Pinpoint 1-1` lases on 1688" is half a fact; the half a player acts on is that
his own GBU-12s and pod are already there. Both briefing views carry it, and so
does the `kneeboard.remark` — pydcs writes the code into no field, so nothing
about it is derivable.

### The spot has to be up before the jet is there

As DCS ships it, the AI controller's spot lives inside the check-in and the
talk-on, over a set the player has to be tuned to, in range of and — a ground
JTAC being a ground unit — in line of sight of. Every low route in this project
is built to deny exactly that, so the laser comes up after the pass or not at
all.

`laser.arm_autolase` puts the spot where the briefing already said it was: on the
target from mission start, held on the nearest vehicle the designator can **see**
(`land.isVisible`, measured) inside its own reach, moved as the target drives,
and gone when the team is dead. It reads nothing about the player. The stock task
stays: `fac_attack_group` is still what talks and what makes the controller
acquire.

```python
laser.arm_autolase(m, [laser.LaserSpot(
    tacp, detachment, code=_LASER_CODE, label="Pinpoint 1-1",
    lead_correction=True,          # the target is driving and there is one pass
)])
```

An IR pointer goes up on the same point by default, which is what makes the
target findable through goggles or an IR pod at night. `lead_correction` is
CTLD's `laseSpotCorrections` — off by default, because it is a correction for the
way a DCS LGB trails a moving spot rather than something the crew computes; both
missions where the player takes an AI spot (`coastal_cover`, `kuban_forge`) carry
it. `trace=True` writes each decision to `dcs.log` under `LASER/<label>` and
nothing to the screen, like `core/iads.py`'s trace.

Arm this where a **player** takes the controller's laser. `idlib_gauntlet`
deliberately does not: there the laser is for `Pontiac`, an AI Hornet, and an AI
flight needs no radio conversation to use a spot.

It says nothing on the radio, on purpose — every call here goes through
`core/triggers.py` so screen text and TTS cannot drift, and a Lua-side call would
be text-only. When the laser comes and goes with the terrain, the mission says so
with its own triggers on the geometry that decides it (`coastal_cover`'s party
calls the sight line opening and closing off zones on the road it is watching).
And the briefing has to say the spot is already up, or the feature is invisible
the way `core/jtac.py`'s readout was: a player taught that a JTAC needs a
check-in will spend the window doing one.

*The argument for the one-code rule, the case `set_code`'s refusal was written
for, and which five of CTLD's decisions were taken as they are (and why the
method is reimplemented rather than vendored) are in `core/laser.py`'s docstring
and `core/lua/vendor/README.md`.*

## Voice-over helper (project-owned)

[`VoiceSynth`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/tts/synth.py) renders TTS audio
(Piper by default), caches WAVs to `cache/voice/`, registers them on
`mission.map_resource`, and appends the right `SoundTo*` action to a trigger
rule. Every mission instantiates one in `__init__` (`self._voice =
VoiceSynth()`). Methods (text matches the on-screen `MessageTo*` body
word-for-word):

```python
self._voice.attach_to_all(m, rule, text)
self._voice.attach_to_coalition(m, rule, text, coalition="blue")   # or "red"
self._voice.attach_to_group(m, rule, text, group_id=group.id)
```

Cache key combines `backend.fingerprint()` + text, so swapping voice or backend
invalidates without collision. Renders are deterministic per backend; commit the
cache only if you want reproducible CI builds (we don't).

For audio played from **mission Lua** rather than a trigger action, use
`self._voice.register(m, text) -> str`: it renders, adds the WAV to the mission,
and returns the in-`.miz` file name that `trigger.action.outSound*(…, "<name>.wav")`
expects (the `SoundTo*` actions take a resource key instead — that is what
`attach_to_*` wires up).

## Map-drawing helper (project-owned)

[`PlanOverlay`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/map_draw.py) wraps the pydcs F10
drawing API (PYDCS_REFERENCE.md, *F10 map drawings*) and paints the *plan* on the
blue layer. It owns two things the raw pydcs `Layer` does not: **faction-correct
placement** (always the blue `StandardLayer`) and **difficulty-scaled enemy
reveal**. The base constructs it per mission and hands it to `_assemble`, so a
mission whose geometry needs an estimate has no ordering to think about.

```python
plan = PlanOverlay(m, "trained")           # or Difficulty.TRAINED
plan.objective(scene.ao_center, "AO — convoy axis", radius=6_000.0)
plan.route(corridor, "Dodge ingress")      # list[Point] of the flown route
plan.orbit(p1, p2, "Eagle CAP")            # a friendly race-track leg
plan.waypoint_label(pos, "Magic AWACS")
plan.threat(sa13_pos, radius=8_000.0, label="SA-13", icon=StandardIcon.AirDefense)
plan.mobile_threat(convoy_pos, "Convoy SHORAD", icon=StandardIcon.Mechanized)
plan.threat_area(center, 28_000.0, "SA-6 + bandit CAP — vicinity")
plan.frontline(front.trace, "FRONT LINE — guns and MANPADS below 10,000")
```

Pass **absolute** world `Point`s — `PlanOverlay` does the layer selection, colour
choice (enemy red / friendly cyan / objective amber), the anchor-relative offset
math the point-list drawings need, and the difficulty policy.

**`.threat()` is the difficulty dial, and what it dials is precision, not
presence**: full icon + true ring on `recruit`, coarse + offset + "(est.)" on
`trained`, wider/dashed/unfilled and further off truth with "(approx.)" on
`veteran`/`ace`. `.objective()` tightens and loosens the same way. **Every
difficulty draws a ring** and hands the estimate back; withholding it never
withheld the *position*, it moved the leak to the steerpoint the mission then
built from the truth (`core/map_draw.py`'s docstring has the incident).

Friendly-plan calls (`route`, `orbit`, `waypoint_label`, `umbrella`) always draw
precisely. Two of those precisions are load-bearing rather than incidental:
`umbrella` is our own SAMs (`core/sanctuary.py`) and a pilot who is hit and low
on fuel cannot use a refuge drawn 6 km off truth; `.frontline()` is the one
*enemy* call drawn precisely at every difficulty, because a front line is ground
both armies have held for weeks and "cross at the seam" needs something on the
map to point at. The air defence sitting on it still goes through `.threat()` /
`.mobile_threat()`.

`.threat()` **returns** the `(center, radius)` it drew, and
`.estimate(center, radius=…)` gives the same pair without drawing — for any
mission whose flight plan refers to a site. The estimate is **memoised on the
true position**, so the map ring, the cartridge point, the target steerpoint and
the kneeboard line are one object rather than four guesses. Feed it to
`core/dtc.py` via `dtc.briefed` rather than re-deriving it. The rule:

> **Every planned point that refers to an enemy site derives from the estimate,
> never from the site.** Then nothing the player can read — F10, DED, HSD,
> kneeboard — carries a better position than the briefing admits to, and a
> steerpoint that lands near the truth is luck rather than a leak.

The deliberate exception is `core/routing.py`, whose rings keep a flight alive
rather than telling the player anything and therefore use the truth. Where the
two visibly disagree on the map, the briefing has to be what explains it
(`abkhaz_sweep`'s module docstring is the worked example).

**A ring is only for something emplaced**, and the two signatures carry the rule:
`.threat()` returns its estimate and `.mobile_threat()` **returns nothing**, so a
system that drives cannot end up frozen into a pre-planned cartridge point.
Ground truth: a group with waypoints is mobile.

`PlanOverlay` also **remembers what it drew** — `plan.lines()` and `plan.marks()`
hand back every polyline and every labelled point at the position it was painted,
which is what `core/dtc.py` turns into steerpoints and GEO lines. The reveal
policy therefore stays here even though the cartridge is written elsewhere: there
is no truth in either list to out-claim the map with.

Missions call this in a `_draw_plan` step near the end of `_assemble` and hand
what it returns back as `Assembled.briefed_threats`. Whether it runs before or
after the trigger steps does not matter — drawing reads no trigger state. Spawn
helpers that own friendly geometry return their `Point`s so `_draw_plan` can
annotate them. Design rules (what to draw, reveal per label, and that a site may
be left off the map on purpose) live in the `dcs-mission` skill.

[`core/visibility.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/visibility.py) owns the other
half of that policy — **what the map does not show**:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.visibility import conceal, conceal_country

conceal_country(russia, syria)   # every group those countries own
conceal(convoy, sa6, reserve)    # or a hand-picked list; None entries skipped
```

Both set `hidden` / `hidden_on_planner` / `hidden_on_mfd` (F10 map, briefing
mission-planner map, datalink) — cosmetic only, the group still spawns, radiates
and shoots. They live outside `map_draw.py` because they never touch a drawing.
**Missions never call either** — the base sweeps the whole enemy coalition
(`conceal_coalition`, driven off the side the client slots are *not* on), so a
late-activated reserve or a second enemy country cannot be forgotten. A mission
that wants something left visible on purpose overrides `_finish_briefing`. The
raw pydcs attributes are in PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §5.

## Data-cartridge helper (project-owned)

[`dtc`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/dtc.py) puts the briefed plan in the
cockpit. The F-16C draws surface-to-air envelopes on the HSD and HAD from its
**data cartridge**, not from the RWR: up to fifteen pre-planned threat points in
steerpoints 56–70, each with a position, a three-character code and the system's
range and ceiling. DCS reads them from a `DTC/<name>.dtc` JSON file inside the
`.miz` plus a per-unit `DTC` key naming the cartridges that slot carries — and
pydcs writes neither.

Feed it what the F10 plan *drew*, not the site's true position:

```python
hsd = dtc.briefed(
    plan.threat(sa6_pos, radius=12_000.0, label="SA-6", icon=StandardIcon.AirDefense),
    dtc.SA_6,
)
# ...then hand `hsd` back as `Assembled.briefed_threats`. The base loads it.
```

This matters more here than on the map: a pre-planned threat *is* a steerpoint,
so a point on the true position is coordinates the player reads straight out of
the DED, and it would undo a reveal the F10 map had just applied.

- `arm_hsd_threats(m, points, *, name="THREATS", overlay=None)` — builds one
  cartridge, marks it default + `AutoLoad` (the rings are up before the player
  touches the DTE page) and attaches it to every **player-flown F-16C** unit.
  Empty `points` writes nothing; more than fifteen points, or no Viper slot to
  load, raises. It also `record_briefed`s the points, because **the cartridge is
  only the Viper's copy of the briefed picture** — `core/kneeboard` prints the
  identical list for whoever is not flying one. A package with no Viper calls
  `dtc.record_briefed(m, points)` directly.
- `briefed(estimate, system, *, label=None)` — pass the **same `label` the
  `plan.threat` call above it was given**. It never reaches the jet (three
  characters, `system.code`); it is what makes the kneeboard call a belt what the
  map calls it. `ThreatPoint.title()` resolves it, falling back to the jet's own
  table name with its `SAM `/`SPAAA `/`AAA ` dialog prefix trimmed;
  `ThreatPoint.hsd_code()` is the three characters.
- `ThreatSystem` constants (`dtc.SA_2`, `dtc.SA_6`, `dtc.SA_19`, `dtc.HAWK`, …)
  are the jet's own `THREAT_PTS_defs` rows — `def_num`, exact name, code, range,
  ceiling. Adding a system is a table entry.
- Every `mirror_*` flag is the editor's **"Do not upload tab data"** checkbox and
  defaults to *on*, so `mirror_THREAT_PTS` has to be `False` or the jet takes the
  cartridge and then declines to read the tab. The other tabs stay mirrored on
  purpose — uploading an empty steerpoint or comms tab would wipe the mission's
  own route and radio presets.
- **Missions never write the file** — `build_miz` calls `dtc.write_cartridges`
  after `m.save(...)`, since the cartridge is a file *inside* the package.

Only **emplaced** systems the briefing names reach the cartridge, which follows
from `mobile_threat` returning nothing for `briefed` to load. EWRs are not rings
either, and neither are ground-force markers. The F/A-18C has a cartridge too,
but its threats are `MEZ_THRTS` on the SA page — a second table, not a parameter
— and no other module in DCS draws a pre-planned ring.

### The rest of the F10 plan: steerpoints and GEO lines

`arm_plan(m, plan, *, overlay, name="THREATS")` fills the two other tabs **off
the `PlanOverlay` itself**, so the map and the cockpit are read from one place.
Both `arm_*` calls fill their own tab of the *same* cartridge (the jet loads one
default) and either may be made without the other.

- **`NAV_PTS`, steerpoints 1–25.** The flight's own route first, then the plan's
  marks **in the mission's own draw order**. Which marks qualify: the objective
  as a `TGT`, the mission's text labels, the air defence that moves, a vague
  enemy area, and one steerpoint per **orbit** at the midpoint of the race-track
  (what a pilot wants from a tanker station is a range and a bearing). Emplaced
  threats are deliberately absent — they are already the pre-planned threat
  points, and a second copy costs a navigation slot for nothing. An `umbrella`
  ring takes no slot at all.
- **Draw order is a total order.** `PlanLine.seq` / `PlanMark.seq` number both
  lists from one counter and `plan_steerpoints` interleaves by it, so "a mission
  that cares which point survives draws it first" is true for lines as well as
  marks.
- **The route's steerpoints carry a `TOS`**, and the plan's marks do not. A route
  point's time is the same instant the kneeboard's route card prints, so there is
  one schedule and the card's zero-wind caveat covers the DED with it. **The
  clock is zulu and the card's is local**; the offset is `Terrain.utc_offset` and
  the trap is in `core/dtc.py`'s docstring. `FIX_Time` stays off everywhere: it
  makes the *speed* derived from the times, and the mission tuned those per
  airframe.
- **`GEO_LINES`, steerpoints 31–55.** Twenty-five vertices shared between **four**
  polylines, so this is the scarce tab and the order matters: front lines, then a
  corridor the flight does not itself fly, then orbit tracks with whatever is
  left. Line index is a colour — enemy geometry asks for red, the friendly plan
  for green. A line over its share is thinned with both ends kept. **A `route`
  line the flight itself flies is dropped**: the HSD already joins the
  steerpoints, so what survives is a lane somebody else flies.
- **The route wins every budget fight.** Uploading a steerpoint tab *replaces*
  the flight plan DCS put in the cockpit, so a plan that would push past
  twenty-five points loses its own marks, never the pilot's navigation.
  `overlay` is required rather than optional: every point carries the terrain
  elevation under it, and a route at sea level would be worse than the mirrored
  default it replaces.
- **The route is re-read at write time**, not when the mission arms it, because
  `build_miz` snaps altitudes and rewrites the departure speed after `_assemble`
  returns. Same reason the kneeboard is written last.
- Two player Viper *flights* raise: there is one steerpoint tab and every Viper
  slot loads it.

## Datalink-identity helper (project-owned)

[`datalink`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/datalink.py) makes a coop flight show
up on its own scopes. Two things the ME writes for every aircraft and pydcs
writes for none decide that:

- **`AddPropAircraft`** carries the identity — the track number (`STN_L16` on
  Link 16, `SADL_TN` on the A-10's SADL) and the callsign the datalink displays
  it under (`VoiceCallsignLabel` + `VoiceCallsignNumber`). pydcs seeds those keys
  from the type's `property_defaults`, where all three are `None`, and never
  fills them: the whole package spawns anonymous, and identical.
- **`datalinks`** is the per-unit network table the four modules with a Datalink
  dialog (F-16C, F/A-18C, A-10C II, AH-64D) read their team members out of.
  pydcs has no field for it, so the F-16's MIDS comes up with an empty flight and
  no other player's PPLI symbol ever appears.

`assign_datalink_identities(m)` fills both, mission-wide and in group-id order
(deterministic, so the `.miz` stays byte-identical): a unique track number per
aircraft in per-flight blocks (`00101`, `00102`, …, `00201`), the ME's own
two-letter tag plus flight digits off the pydcs callsign (`Springfield11` → `SD`
+ `11`), and each flight listed as its own team members. **Missions never call
it** — `build_miz` does, right after `snap_base_waypoints`.

Adding a module is a `_NETS` table entry — its dialog defaults and whether its
team members carry a TDOA flag, both read off
`<DCS>/CoreMods/aircraft/<module>/Datalinks/*.lua`. The AH-64D is deliberately
absent: its IDM has a different shape (`TN_IDM_LB` / `OwnshipCallSign`) and no
mission here flies one. Writing the table at all needs
[`core/unit_extras.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/unit_extras.py) — a
one-wrapper patch of `FlyingUnit.dict`, shared with `core/dtc.py` because two
mission-file unit keys have no pydcs field. Register with
`emit_unit_key("datalinks", "datalinks")`; **do not** write a second wrapper —
two wrappers each guarding on their own marker re-wrap the chain on every build.

## Radio-frequency helper (project-owned)

[`radio`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/radio.py) puts a flight's frequency in the
field DCS binds a radio to. `Mission.awacs_flight` and `Mission.refuel_flight`
take a `frequency=` argument and spend it on a `SetFrequency` **waypoint task**,
leaving the group's own `frequency` field on the 251 MHz that
`MovingGroup.__init__` gives every group. The group field is what a player's
radio has to match to raise an AI controller at all; the waypoint task retunes
the AI minutes into its own route.

`tune_working_frequencies(m)` mirrors the intent back into the field,
mission-wide. **Missions never call it** — `build_miz` does, after
`assign_datalink_identities` and before the save. `working_frequency(group)` is
the single resolution both it and the comms card read, most specific source
first — a FAC task's own params, then a `SetFrequencyCommand`, then nothing — so
the card cannot print a number the sweep did not tune anyone to.

Two things it deliberately leaves alone, each a way a blanket sweep would break
something:

- **A group holding a client slot.** `FlyingGroup.set_frequency` also sets
  `radioSet`, DCS's "this mission overrides the cockpit preset table" flag, which
  writes the group frequency into channel 1 of the first compatible radio — and
  the comms card annotates frequencies with their preset channel on the
  assumption nothing overrides it.
- **Ground groups.** A `VehicleGroup` writes no frequency unless `communication`
  is set, and a ground JTAC's radio is the frequency inside its own FAC task
  params, which the card already prints.

One thing left as it was on purpose: the **player flight's own** group field
stays at pydcs's 251. That is the flight's intra-flight frequency rather than
anything the player has to raise, and moving it means overriding the preset table
the card is annotated from.

*The evidence — every tanker here was briefed on a frequency it was not on, and
ED's own working example — is in `core/radio.py`'s docstring.*

## Recon-still helper (project-owned)

[`recon`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/recon/) renders the imagery a briefing
claims, from the overlay rasters plus the positions of the groups the mission
spawned, and ships it twice: as a `pictureFileNameB` slide inside the `.miz` (the
briefing screen) and as a PNG beside the README, which embeds it.

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core.recon import Chrome, Frame, Mark, road_column
from dcs_mission_creator.core.recon import publish as recon

column = road_column(overlay, scene.convoy_origin, scene.convoy_destination, 11)
returns = plan.detections(column)          # the reveal gate; [] at veteran/ace
if returns:
    self._still = recon.sensor_still(
        m,
        Frame.along_axis(returns[0], returns[-1], heading_offset_deg=-90.0),
        [Mark(x=p.x, y=p.y) for p in returns] + [group_mark],
        Chrome(platform="MQ-9 / AN-APY-8 LYNX II", mode="WAS-MTI  5 LOOK",
               taken_at="0540L  12 SEP 26", caption="..."),
        overlay=scene.overlay.overlay, slug=self.name, label="convoy",
    )
```

**It is a radar product, not a photograph, and that is forced by the data.** A
vehicle is a fifth of a pixel at the honest scale, so detections are **symbology
drawn after the sensor chain**, never hot blobs in it. Two rules govern what may
appear:

- **Statistics may be modelled; features may not.** Open ground carries a
  correlated roughness field, which claims "this ground has roughness variation
  at about this scale" — true — and does not claim a hedge or a parcel boundary
  anywhere. Never draw a feature the overlay does not know about.
- **`PlanOverlay.detections` is the only source of positions.** A still is a
  third reveal channel beside the F10 plan and the HSD cartridge, so it answers
  to the same difficulty policy: `detections` returns `[]` at `veteran`/`ace` and
  the mission then publishes no frame. Its `trained` error is **one registration
  bias shared by the whole cluster** plus small per-return jitter — offsetting
  each vehicle independently stops it reading as a column. `bias_m` is
  **calibration, not policy**: the 1.2 km default is for a frame with no landmark
  in it, and a frame that paints the road net has to cut it to a couple of
  hundred metres, because a product is registered against what it can see.

**A mission gets a still only if the overlay can carry its subject**, which has
to be measured rather than assumed — the overlay has no aeroway layer, so a
mission whose objective is an apron renders farmland with a bracket in the middle
of it. `coastal_cover` and `kodori_strike` carry one; `eastern_shield` cannot.
The two `ace` missions need no judgement call, since `detections` returns `[]`.

**Landmarks are what make a still usable.** `landmark_marks(overlay, frame,
avoid=<the marks you are about to draw>)` labels the settlements in a register
deliberately unlike the sensor's own symbology. Three rules, all enforced in
code: only what the raster drew (names come from a `places.geojson` sidecar
holding just the OSM place classes `buildings.zarr` was rasterized from);
collision is tested on the **ink**, via `render.mark_extent`, which returns the
pixel box a mark covers, symbol *and* text; and it is **not a reveal channel**,
so ranking is class then distance to the frame centre, a sort plus a greedy walk
rather than a sample, because the render cache keys on the marks.

The sidecar is its own build layer, cheap and independent of the rasters, so it
can be added to an overlay that is already built:

```bash
uv run dcs-mission-creator map-overlay build caucasus --layers places
```

It is a `node["place"]` Overpass query per tile — ~100 KB each, cached beside the
main tiles, resumable — **not** a re-parse of those tiles. `MapOverlay.places`
returns `[]` with one warning when the sidecar is absent, so an older overlay
yields a still with no labels instead of a failed build. Names come from
`name:en` and must be ASCII: DejaVu Sans Mono has no glyph for several Abkhaz
letters and they render as tofu.

Also load the column with `road_column`, not from `group.units[*].position`:
pydcs `vehicle_group_platoon` uses `Formation.Line`, which stacks units 20 m
apart **abeam** the heading, and DCS only strings them along the road once the
mission runs.

The cache mirrors `VoiceSynth`: `cache/recon/<slug>-<label>-<hash8>.png`, keyed
on the **sampled scene** rather than the query, so rebuilding the overlay
invalidates it. The renderer is seeded from that key alone (never stdlib
`random`, whose stream depends on how many draws the mission already made), and
the file's mtime and mode are pinned because `zipf.write` records both into the
archive. Missions never copy the file — `build_miz` does.

*The measurements behind the scale and the roughness field are in
[render.py](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/recon/render.py)'s docstring; the
landmark rules and the case that produced them in `core/recon/landmark.py`. That
imagery is a consistency check on a mission's own geography — `kodori_strike`
briefed a FOB 19 km from where it built one — is in that mission's
`_setup_airports`.*

## Kneeboard helper (project-owned)

[`kneeboard`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/kneeboard/) writes the cards the
player reads with the jet already moving. All of them **derived from the built
mission**, so none can contradict the route, the package or the fields it came
from:

- **flight plan** — **one line per waypoint**, and one table: position in degrees
  and decimal minutes, terrain elevation, magnetic track, leg distance, altitude,
  commanded TAS, ETE and ETA. Then the **briefed threats**; then the departure
  and recovery fields with their elevation and this flight's own parking slot;
  then the weather the timings were flown against.
- **comms** — your flight, the package, the controllers, each relevant field's
  ATC bands, and the theater navaids. A frequency that happens to be a channel on
  the player airframe's own default preset table is annotated with it
  (`251.000 AM  R1 CH18`) — the table is `FlyingType.panel_radio`, and the
  annotation is the difference between a card that saves time and one that lists
  numbers.
- **airfield**, and this one is **conditional**: written only for a field the
  theatre ships no chart of. Position, elevation, runways with any measured ILS
  course, navaids with bearing and range, which flight parks where, and a
  north-up plan view.

**The threat block prints the briefed picture rather than adding to it** — it
comes from `dtc.briefed_threats(m)`, the same estimates the cartridge was loaded
from, so the difficulty policy stays in `map_draw.py`. Each row carries the
pre-planned steerpoint it occupies (`dtc.FIRST_STEERPOINT`, 56 upward), the
three-character HSD code, the position in DDM, the system's published range and
ceiling, and bearing/range from bullseye. *Why those columns and not others — a
kneeboard column earns its place by being unrecoverable in the cockpit — is in
`core/kneeboard/pages.py`.*

Two mission-side consequences:

- **`arm_hsd_threats` records the points**, so a Viper mission gets the block for
  free. A package with **no Viper** calls `dtc.record_briefed(m, points)` itself
  and gets the card without the cartridge.
- **Pass `plan.threat`'s own `label` to `dtc.briefed`** so the card names a belt
  the way the map and the briefing name it. Unlabelled, a row falls back to the
  jet's own table name with its dialog-box prefix trimmed (`SA-6 'GAINFUL'`).

**A table that does not fit repeats its column headers and numbers its parts**
(`ROUTE (1 OF 2)` / `ROUTE (2 OF 2)`), because a column of figures with nothing
written over it is a column nobody can read. `Page.parts()` is the layout as
text, which is what the tests assert on.

**The airfield card is conditional because ED's coverage is.** Where the theatre
ships its own chart (`Mods/terrains/<Theater>/Kneeboard/`) that is a surveyed
drawing and strictly better than anything derivable here, so
[`kneeboard/charts.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/kneeboard/charts.py) answers
the question by looking — matching the airport name against the chart file names,
since pydcs carries no ICAO to join on. **With no install the answer is unknown
and the card is written**: a redundant page costs a page, a missing one costs the
player their field's elevation, its ATC channel and where their jet is parked.

**Missions call none of it.** `build_miz` calls `kneeboard.publish(m, miz_path,
overlay=…, title=…)` after the save (the pages are files *inside* the package)
and after every other finishing step, because the route card reads the take-off
and landing altitudes `snap_base_waypoints` has just corrected. The PNGs also
land in `<output>/kneeboard/`, next to the README, because a card that can only
be read inside the game cannot be reviewed.

A mission may add free-text lines to the comms card's REMARKS block, for the few
facts that are real but in no field pydcs writes:

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import kneeboard

kneeboard.remark(m, f"Hammer 1-1 lases the column on code {_LASER_CODE}.")
kneeboard.remark(m, "Target coordinates in your own cockpit's format: "
                    "F10 -> Other -> Hammer 1-1.")
```

Remarks are **wrapped** rather than clipped, and continuation lines are indented.
But the wrap is a floor and one line of `kneeboard.page.COLUMNS` (98) is the
ceiling: a remark that needs a second line is one that should have been shorter
(*why*, with the worked case, is in `core/kneeboard/publish.py`'s docstring).
Keep the list short anyway — everything else on the cards is derived and should
stay that way. These cards are what makes "Batumi tower: per kneeboard" true.

**Three things about the mechanism, each a way the feature would otherwise be
quietly wrong:**

- **pydcs's own `Mission.add_aircraft_kneeboard` is not used** — it writes an
  archive entry with an empty path component (PYDCS_REFERENCE.md §8). The pages
  are appended with the arcname spelled out and an explicit `ZipInfo`, exactly as
  `core/dtc.py` appends its cartridges.
- **DCS has no per-flight kneeboard.** A page goes in a folder named after an
  aircraft *type* and every pilot of that type sees it, so a mission with two
  player flights of different airframes gets both route cards in both folders and
  each card names its flight in the title.
- **Timings are zero-wind and tracks are magnetic off a per-theater table**
  (`flightplan.VARIATION_DEG_EAST`), both printed on the page so they can be
  checked. *Why the wind is not corrected for, and why a runway designator is not
  a heading you may convert, are in `core/kneeboard/flightplan.py`.*

### Navaids come from the installed game

pydcs knows a beacon *exists* and nothing else: `Airport.beacons` is a list of
`AirportBeacon(id='airfield22_3')` — an id, no type, no frequency, no position —
and `Airport.tacan` is `None` for every Caucasus field, Batumi included, which
has one. [`kneeboard/beacons.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/kneeboard/beacons.py)
reads `Mods/terrains/<Theater>/Beacons.lua` out of the install instead, the same
file DCS's own F10 airdrome panel reads. `core/dcs_install.py` already locates the
install, so there is nothing new to configure; with it absent the navaid block
comes out empty and the build still succeeds. Nothing from the install is copied
into a generated mission — only numbers computed from it.

A label with nowhere to go on the plan view is **dropped**, never overprinted: it
is in the navaid table above the sketch either way. Same rule as
`core/recon/landmark.py`. *Why the parsing is shaped the way it is — the
`{x, altitude, z}` axis order, the join on beacon id rather than distance, the
ILS-callsign pairing — is in that module's docstring.*

# Loadouts

## DCS installation (loadouts)

pydcs reads stock payloads out of the **installed game**, and finds it only
through the Windows registry — under WSL that fails, so
`load_task_default_loadout()` silently leaves every pylon empty.
[`core/dcs_install.py`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/dcs_install.py) fixes that
from the `DCS_INSTALL_DIR` env var; `MissionBuilder.__init__` calls
`dcs_install.configure()` before any flight exists (pydcs caches its payload
directories on first use), so missions need to do nothing.

```bash
export DCS_INSTALL_DIR="/mnt/e/Games/DCS World OpenBeta"   # 'E:\Games\…' also accepted
# optional: only if the Saved Games folder isn't auto-found
export DCS_SAVED_GAMES_DIR="/mnt/c/Users/<user>/Saved Games/DCS.openbeta"
```

Unset, the helper logs a warning and the DCS task defaults come back empty.
Liveries stay at the DCS default even when set — pydcs's livery scanner splits
paths on `\` and cannot be used off Windows (see the docstring).

**Arm every blue flight explicitly — never rely on the task default.** It is
sourced from the installed game, so it is empty without `DCS_INSTALL_DIR` and is
whatever DCS happens to frag with it otherwise. Use
[`mission_kit.arm`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/mission_kit.py), which clears
the stations first so no default survives on a station the list skips:

```python
arm(player, planes.F_16C_50, [
    (1, "AIM_120C_AMRAAM___Active_Radar_AAM"),
    (2, "AIM_9X_Sidewinder_IR_AAM"),
    (3, "AGM_88C_HARM___High_Speed_Anti_Radiation_Missile_"),
    (4, "Fuel_tank_370_gal"),
    (10, "AN_ASQ_213_HTS___HARM_Targeting_System"),
])
```

Write the list at the spawn site, not in a shared catalogue — a loadout is force
composition, and one mission's package should not constrain another's. The
`PylonN` classes on each `PlaneType` enumerate what a station legally takes, so
read the names off pydcs rather than guessing; a wrong one is an `AttributeError`
at build time instead of a silent empty rail.

**Legal is not realistic**, and `core/loadout_check` is what says so
mechanically. Three station facts, all legal in pydcs and all wrong:

- **F-16C wingtips (1/9) carry the AIM-120, not the AIM-9.** Where the
  Sidewinders go depends on the fit: in a **SEAD or strike** fit 3/7 are the HARM
  rails or the bomb stations, so the AIM-9X move out to 2/8; in a **pure
  air-to-air** fit ED fills outboard-in with AMRAAM on 1/2/8/9 and puts the
  AIM-9X on 3/7.
- **Every ED two-tank F-16C payload carries an ALQ-184 on the centreline**
  (station 5).
- **The F-15C never flies a single wing tank.** Its fuel stations are 2, 6 and
  10; every ED payload that carries fuel uses 6, and the wing pair only ever comes
  as 2 + 10.

Also check the loadout against the *sortie*: a modern CAS or LGB tasking wants a
targeting pod on the jet that needs one — except the A-10C, whose TGP is
integrated (no ED payload lists an AAQ-28, so don't add one).

## Loadouts are split across the flight (project-owned)

**Every mission is built for at least two coop slots**
(`MissionBuilder.MIN_PLAYERS`, and both CLIs default to it), and the two slots do
not carry the same jet. [`loadout`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/loadout.py) is
the table that says who carries what.

The reason is arithmetic. An F-16C-50 has eleven stations, and with the bags on
4/6, the ALQ-184 on 5 and the pods on 10/11, what is left is 1/2/3/7/8/9 — of
which **1/2 and 8/9 take a missile and nothing else**. So *three* stations decide
the sortie, and a jet that spends 3/7 on HARM has no bomb while one that spends
them on bombs has no HARM.

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import loadout

_FITS = (
    loadout.Loadout(
        role="HARM/HTS",                       # short — the kneeboard prints it
        carries="two AGM-88C, HTS pod, four AIM-120C, ALQ-184, two 370 gal",
        stores=((1, _AMRAAM), ..., (10, _HTS), (11, _TGP)),
    ),
    loadout.Loadout(
        role="CBU-97*4",
        carries="four CBU-97 SFW on TERs, LITENING pod, ...",
        stores=(...),
    ),
)

sections = player_flight(..., slots=self.players, loadouts=_FITS)
```

`player_flight` **cycles the table over the slots in order**, across sections
rather than restarting per section. That is the whole scaling rule: two slots are
the complementary pair the mission was written for, four are two elements each
carrying the same split, and a mission that wants a third capability at four
slots declares a third fit. Slot 1 always gets the first fit, so the briefing can
name who is carrying what without holding the built mission.

**The fits are written per unit.** `FlyingGroup.load_pylon` writes the same store
to every airframe in the group, so arming a flight through it can only ever
produce a uniform one; `loadout.arm_unit` is the per-slot half, and it clears the
stations first for the same reason `mission_kit.arm` does. `mission_kit.arm` is
still the right call for an **AI** flight, which is uniform by nature.

**Three views, one table.** The fits are a module constant so `readme()` — which
holds no `Mission` — can render them too:

- `self.loadout_table(flight, _FITS)` — the README's markdown table, one row per
  slot, with the slot column holding the `"<group> Pilot #<n>"` string DCS puts
  on the slot-selection screen.
- `self.loadout_brief(flight, _FITS)` — the same table as plain text for
  `set_description_text`, wrapped narrow.
- the **kneeboard remark**, written by `MissionBuilder._remark_loadouts` for
  every mission so none can forget it: `Dodge fits: #1/#3 HARM/HTS; #2/#4
  CBU-105*4`. Slots are grouped by fit rather than listed one per slot, because a
  six-slot flight listed individually runs past the card's 98 columns.

`role` is a dozen characters, named after the weapon that decides the job.
**How to choose the split** — the four patterns and the rules between them — is
SKILL.md's *The flight splits its loadout*.

`loadout.air_to_air_shots` counts the missiles off the loaded stores, and
`MissionBuilder.air_to_air_shots(_FITS)` sums them over the assignment — which is
what the force-balance rule below divides by two, so a mission scaling its
opposition off `--players` cannot drift from what the jets are carrying.

## Legal is not realistic (project-owned)

[`loadout_check`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/loadout_check.py) reads ED's own
payload tables out of the installed game and answers "which stations does the
game actually hang this store on". pydcs only checks that a station *accepts* a
store.

```python
for note in loadout_check.check(planes.F_16C_50, fit.stores):
    print(note)   # station 11: Sniper ATP — no shipped payload carries it;
                  # the game ships AN/AAQ-28 LITENING here
```

**A note names what the game ships on that station instead**, which is what
separates a swapped pair from a sub-variant substitution — two thirds of this
repo's findings were the second kind, and without that half they read
identically to the first. With no `DCS_INSTALL_DIR` there is nothing to read and
every check returns empty, exactly as `load_task_default_loadout` does; the audit
says so out loud rather than reporting a clean bill of health it did not earn.
*The two joins that make the lookup work, and why they cannot share one, are in
the module docstring.*

## Force balance: the magazine is the budget

**A mission may not task more kills than the player flight is carrying weapons
for**, and the number of player slots is an argument, so both sides have to be
computed rather than typed.

- **Count the stations, don't assume.** An F-16C-50 with two wing tanks has
  exactly six air-to-air stations — 1/2/8/9 and 3/7 — because stations 4 and 6
  *accept no missile at all*. Six is a ceiling, not a choice.
- **Two shots per kill** is the planning factor against `Skill.Excellent`
  fighters. So one player jet is worth ~3 kills, and the flight's budget is the
  sum over its slots — **not** three times the slot count once the fits differ: a
  Viper carrying HARMs or bombs on 3/7 is worth two. Count it with
  `MissionBuilder.air_to_air_shots(_FITS)`, which reads the rails rather than a
  constant, and let the opposition follow it.
- **Then pick one of three levers**, all legitimate:
  1. **Scale the opposition off the magazine** (`abkhaz_sweep._plan_bandits`), so
     the number of bandits is derived rather than chosen.
  2. **Add friendly AI** — but this trades away mission character: "no tanker, no
     escort, nothing else airborne" *is* the ace composition in some missions. The
     player's own wingman is not this lever either; he is already priced in.
  3. **Task less than the airspace.** Not every enemy has to be a required kill.
     Make the objective the element that gates the campaign effect and let the
     rest be a threat to survive — a reinforcement the player is explicitly
     cleared to leave flying. The win trigger then names only the tasked groups.

Two things follow for the code. A DCS plane group holds **at most four
airframes**, so a scaled element is a *list* of flights and the win condition ANDs
`GroupDead` over all of them (`_split_flights` also refuses to leave a lone
trailer behind a four-ship, since that would gate a win on one jet). And the
briefing has to state which kill is the frag and which is not, or a player who
disengages correctly cannot tell a designed off-ramp from a broken trigger.

The air-to-air half is mechanical (`air_to_air_shots`); the **air-to-ground half
still has to be counted by hand**, and it is what caught a mission flying a pure
air-to-air fit against a win condition of "the FOB is wrecked". *The worked
example is `abkhaz_sweep`'s module docstring.*

# Tools, in the order you run them

There are four of these and they answer four different questions. Running them
out of order is what makes a mission expensive:

| # | Ask | Tool |
|---|-----|------|
| 1 | Is this **layout** legal — does anything reach anything it should not? | `survey` |
| 2 | Can an aeroplane **fly** the line between those places? | `route` |
| 3 | — write the mission — | |
| 4 | Is the **built** mission internally consistent? | `audit` |

**Survey before you route, route before you write, audit before you say it is
done.** `ansariyah_works` is the worked example of getting it wrong twice in one
build: its target was sited, its corridor planned and half its briefing written
before anybody measured the distance to the southern coastal battery and found
the target **inside** its envelope, and then `audit` was skipped in favour of a
hand-rolled speed audit that found the same three things and missed the rest.

## Siting a mission (project-owned)

[`survey`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/survey.py) answers the question that
comes before `core/route_plan.py`: **where does everything go, and does that
layout hold together?**

```bash
uv run dcs-mission-creator survey syria \
  --point "TARGET@35.1640,36.0860" --point "FEET DRY@35.2100,35.9300" \
  --site "S-125 Tartus@34.9000,35.9200:18000" \
  --site "SA-8 works@35.1550,36.0760:10300" --defends "SA-8 works" \
  --agl 150 --difficulty veteran
```

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import survey

for spot in survey.spots(overlay, anchor, 20_000.0, require, count=8):
    print(spot.row())          # pasteable degrees + elevation, slope, road, name
print(survey.report(survey.reaches(overlay, points, sites, agl_m=150.0)))
survey.covered(rows)           # the list worth a non-zero exit code
```

Three things worth knowing:

- **A margin is measured against what a system reaches, not against the ring the
  map draws.** Those are different numbers and the difference is the reveal
  policy: the first decides whether a pilot who complies with the briefing lives,
  the second is what the plan *looks* like. The report prints both, off
  `map_draw.reveal_policy` so the two cannot drift.
- **The objective's own defences are declared (`--defends`), not inferred.**
  Borrowing `routing.avoid_threats`' rule — a ring covering the target is not a
  finding — was tried and was exactly wrong: the defect this module was written
  after *is* a ring covering the target. Geometry cannot tell the Osa emplaced on
  the works from the belt that reaches it by accident; only the author can.
- **`spots` ranks and describes; `find_placement` samples and returns bare
  points.** Both are reproducible (the sampling is seeded from the overlay), but
  siting wants the best candidate *near where you asked* together with the
  terrain facts and the settlement to name it after.

## Planning a low route (project-owned)

[`route_plan`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/route_plan.py) answers the three
questions a mountain corridor has to answer before a line of the mission is
written. `kuban_forge`'s corridor took most of a day of hand-picking waypoints;
the same corridor comes out of one command in twenty seconds.

```bash
uv run dcs-mission-creator route caucasus \
  --via 42.42,41.90 --via 42.90,41.55 --via 43.24,41.745 --via 43.86,41.90 \
  --threat "SA-11@43.984,41.884" --threat "EWR@43.991,41.970" --speed 680
```

```python
from dcs_mission_creator.core import route_plan

route = route_plan.plan_corridor(overlay, [senaki, kodori, klukhori, works])
print(route.table(("PUSH", "OCHAMCHIRA", "KLUKHOR", "TARGET"), speed_kph=680))
for look in route_plan.sighting(overlay, route.points, [(sa11, "SA-11")],
                                altitudes_m=route.altitude_m):
    print(look.summary())          # "first seen at point 13, 33 km out"
route_plan.nav_headroom(len(route.points))    # marks left in the DTC
```

**`--via` is the steering and the rest is measurement.** Between the anchors a
least-cost search over the elevation raster (cost rises as the cube of the
ground) finds the valley, and then the trace is thinned to the fewest waypoints
whose *straight legs* still clear, by asking `waypoints.leg_violation` which leg
goes deepest into rock and putting a point exactly there. The output is a
paste-ready `_CORRIDOR` table in degrees.

- **The real question is not "how low" but "how low for a waypoint budget I can
  afford".** `--agl` is the dial; raising the mountain band is what buys back
  waypoints on a route that will not fit. Neither half is guessable — the same
  corridor can need twice the waypoints at 250 m that it needs at 600 m while
  staying masked from every radar that matters.
- **`sighting` is the half that cannot be argued.** Line of sight against the
  raster, from a radar mast to the aeroplane at the altitude actually planned. It
  answers only about terrain, which is the only thing DCS models — there is no
  earth curvature, so a mission may promise masking and may not promise a
  horizon.
- **`nav_headroom` is the question nobody thinks to ask until the cartridge is
  full.** The route wins every budget fight in `core/dtc.py`, so a twenty-point
  corridor leaves one navigation steerpoint for the whole F10 plan — and finding
  that out from `arm_plan`'s warning after a build is too late to change the
  route.

Geometry only, like `core/routing.py` and `core/frontline.py`: `Point`s and a
`MapOverlay` in, `Point`s out. What a route *means* stays the mission's decision.

## Auditing a built mission (project-owned)

[`audit`](src/dcs_mission_creator/core/audit.py) checks the mechanical half of
the rules in this file. **Every check exists because the project shipped the
mistake it looks for.**

```bash
uv run dcs-mission-creator audit kuban_forge     # or omit the slug for all of them
```

It runs against `MissionBuilder.assemble` — the mission exactly as it would be
written, finishing steps and all, minus the save. That split is why it is usable
at all: a `generate` renders TTS, writes a five-megabyte archive and draws
kneeboard pages, none of which says anything about whether a waypoint is inside a
mountain. Exit code is non-zero if anything came back at `error`, so it works as
a gate.

What it checks: commanded speeds against each airframe's own `max_speed` (the
knots-for-km/h mistake below the floor, afterburner above it), the departure gate
`set_departure_speeds` is supposed to have corrected, take-off and landing points
sitting on the field, **client** routes against the terrain at every waypoint and
along every leg, the cartridge's navigation headroom, enemy groups left visible
on the F10 map, flights with empty pylons, stores on stations the game itself
does not use, the player flight's air-to-air magazine against the number of
enemy aircraft, and every building objective for a client steerpoint standing on
it. That last one needs no declaration from the mission: a static named by a
trigger condition *is* an objective, so the check derives its own target list
the way the concealment check derives which coalition is the enemy.

**Findings, not failures.** Several are heuristics about design and a mission is
allowed to be deliberate about any of them — an unarmed MQ-9 is what a spotter
is, and a deliberate pod substitution is answered in the mission's own `_FITS`
docstring. That is the system working: the check names the deviation, the mission
answers it in prose, and nothing is silently different from the rest of the
project. The deliberate cases should be the only ones left.

*The three false positives that had to be killed first — `alt_type`, the approach
gate, and water reading as underground — are facts about pydcs rather than about
any mission, and they are in `core/audit.py`'s docstring.*

# Repo hygiene

## Reproducibility

Building the same mission twice produces the same `.miz` **contents**, entry for
entry. Six separate things had to be pinned, and all six are easy to undo by
accident:

- `MapOverlay` carries the sampling `seed` (default 0). `find_placement` takes no
  per-call seed; build the overlay with a different one to resample.
- `MissionBuilder.generate` seeds the stdlib `random` from the mission slug.
- `MissionBuilder._pin_runway_waypoint_distance` — pydcs declares
  `add_runway_waypoint(..., distance=random.randrange(6000, 8000, 100))`, a
  **default argument**, so the value is drawn once when `dcs.unitgroup` is
  imported, before any seeding can run.
- `MissionBuilder._pin_onboard_numbers` — pydcs picks tail numbers with
  `set.pop()` over a set of strings, which follows string hashing.
- `core/recon/publish.py` pins the rendered PNG's **mtime and mode**, because
  pydcs stores a resource as a *path* and writes it at save time with
  `zipf.write`, which records `st_mtime` and the file mode. (The voice cache has
  the same exposure and no pin; it gets away with it only because a warm
  `cache/voice/` leaves the WAV mtimes alone.)
- `core/kneeboard/publish.py` sidesteps that trap instead: the pages are appended
  with an explicit `ZipInfo(date_time=…)` (a fixed 1980 stamp, as in
  `core/dtc.py`). What still has to hold is that the *pixels* are a function of
  the mission — hence one font from `core/fonts.py` rather than whatever the host
  has installed, and `Image.save` with no `pnginfo`, since Pillow writes a `tIME`
  chunk when handed one. The pages are RGB for the reason
  `core/recon/publish.py` documents: DCS renders a single-channel PNG in shades
  of red.

**The archive itself is not byte-identical, and never has been.** `Mission.save`
writes five entries with `zipfile.writestr`, which stamps each with the *current
time*, so two builds more than two seconds apart differ in those five headers
while every byte of content matches. Compare entry contents, not file hashes —
which is what `test_generation_is_reproducible` does. It used to compare whole
files and passed only while both builds landed in the same two-second DOS
timestamp bucket.

## Tests

`tests/` runs without a DCS installation **and** without the built map overlay,
because CI has neither. That is a hard constraint on anything committed here:

- Default selection (`pytest -m "not slow"`) is what CI and pre-commit run.
- `@pytest.mark.slow` is for anything needing the overlay — currently only
  `tests/test_mission_smoke.py`, which skips itself when the overlay is absent.
- A `Mission(Caucasus())` is cheap and needs neither, so core helpers that take a
  mission (`air_defense`, `triggers`, `weather`) are tested normally.
- **Do not assert on mission content.** The smoke test checks that every mission
  builds a readable `.miz` and builds reproducibly, not what is in it; freezing
  composition would make every balance tweak look like a regression.
- The three tool modules follow the same constraint and are worth copying from:
  `test_route_plan.py` stands up a synthetic elevation array with the **real**
  row/column transform on it, so the bulk window and the point query cannot
  disagree about which cell a coordinate is in. `test_audit.py` builds two-point
  missions by hand rather than a real one. `test_loadout_check.py` parses a
  fixture payload block instead of the install.

## Running

(rely on the `DCS_MISSIONS_FOLDER` and `DCS_INSTALL_DIR` env vars being
available)

```bash
uv run python -m dcs_mission_creator.missions.caucasus.coastal_cover --players 2

# or via the unified CLI (auto-discovers every mission module):
uv run dcs-mission-creator list
uv run dcs-mission-creator generate coastal_cover --players 2

# build without saving and report what looks wrong (seconds, not a minute)
uv run dcs-mission-creator audit coastal_cover

# check a layout before anything is written around it (exit 1 = something reaches
# something it should not)
uv run dcs-mission-creator survey syria --point "TARGET@35.164,36.086" \
  --site "S-125 Tartus@34.90,35.92:18000"

# plan a corridor the terrain allows, before writing any of it
uv run dcs-mission-creator route caucasus --via 42.42,41.90 --via 43.86,41.90
```

## Lint and type-check

Always run all four after editing Python under `src/` (and fix what they flag
before reporting a task done):

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/          # lint
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/ # formatting check (use `format` to apply)
uv run ty check src/                   # static type check (astral ty)
uv run pytest -m "not slow"            # what CI and pre-commit run
uv run pytest                          # adds the overlay-dependent smoke test
```

`ruff` and `ty` are pinned in `pyproject.toml`'s `[dependency-groups].dev` and
installed via `uv sync`. `ty` is pre-1.0; tolerate occasional false positives but
do not silence errors blindly — prefer fixing the annotation. For pydcs-induced
invariance complaints on `List[Type[…]]` arguments, cast with
`cast(list[type[VehicleType]], [...])` rather than redesigning the call site.

### Pre-commit (prek)

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` wires the same hooks. Use Astral's
[`prek`](https://github.com/j178/prek) — a Rust drop-in for `pre-commit`:

```bash

The hook fails the commit if `ruff check`, `ruff format`, `ty check` or the fast
test selection reports anything. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same four on
every push.

## Existing missions

They are in [src/dcs_mission_creator/missions/](src/dcs_mission_creator/missions/),
and each module's own docstring is that mission's brief — what it is a reference
for, what its geometry is built on, what it deliberately does not do. Read the
docstring rather than a summary of it; `README.md` has the one-line index. There
is no list of them here on purpose: a count in prose has no owner and goes stale
the first time one is added.

What is worth stating as a *rule* rather than as a catalogue is the one thing
they all do the same way: **every mission draws its plan with `PlanOverlay`,
hands the rings back as `Assembled.briefed_threats`, and lets the base conceal,
load and brief them.** What differs is only how far the estimate sits from truth,
and that is `difficulty` — a `trained` ring is 2 km off, `veteran` a quarter
wider and 4 km off, `ace` wider again and 6 km off. Nothing is withheld entirely
at any label.

Two missions deviate from that on purpose — `kuban_forge` draws an enemy thing
precisely, `ansariyah_works` overrides a briefed radius — and each says why in
its own `_draw_plan`. Read those before copying either.
